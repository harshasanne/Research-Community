A Semantic Repository for Geological Modeling Workflows.Nowadays, many engineering studies are conducted to securely exploit depleted Oil Fields for CO2 Storage.These studies follow complex workflows of data processing services described by geologists. If no explicit semantics is applied to describe these workflows, it is not possible to share them between geologists by reusing existing ones or for composing new ones. The focus of our work is to make the semantics explicit in order to facilitate the geologists daily work. In this article, we first explain how geologists operate today. Then, we enrich such workflows with semantic indexes through ontology based characterizations.
