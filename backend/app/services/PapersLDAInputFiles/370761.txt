BPEL4WS Unit Testing: Framework and Implementation.The Business Process Execution Language for Web Services(BPEL4WS) offers a new standards-based approach to buildingflexible business processes by orchestrating multiple Web Services.Unit testing is critical to guarantee the creation of correct and reliable BPEL4WS business processes. Yet this is a topic that isstill to be explored, both in research and industry. Lack of unit testtooling support has affected BPEL4WS process development interms of quality and efficiency. This paper proposes a BPEL4WSunit test framework, which includes a BPEL4WS process compositionmodel,a test architecture, a lifecycle management schema and atest design outline. An example implementation of the framework illustratesthe whole approach. By adopting this test framework, the experienceof developing, testing and debugging a BPEL4WS processes will begreatly improved.
