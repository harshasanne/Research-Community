Web Services Grid Computing and Business Process Management: Exploiting Complementarities for Business Agility.Recent technologies including web services,business process modeling tools, and grid computing,are key to facilitating business agility. Web servicesstandardize application interfaces to ease inter-applicationcommunication, and facilitate standardsbased business process management. Grid computingprovides a way for virtualizing heterogeneousresources to collectively yield a computationallypowerful IT environment with tremendous promise inimproving utilization levels of individual IT resources.By leveraging web services, a standards based grid isbeing envisaged in the OGSA model. In this paper, weexplore the complementarities of web services andbusiness process management (BPM) technologies. Wealso lay the foundation for using web services basedBPM in solving orchestration and workflow issues ingrid computing.
