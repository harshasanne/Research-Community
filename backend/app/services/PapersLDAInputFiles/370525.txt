Dynamic Workflow Composition using Markov Decision Processes.The advent of Web services has made automated workflowcomposition relevant to web based applications. Onetechnique, that has received some attention, for automaticallycomposing workflows is AI-based classical planning.However, classical planning suffers from the paradox of firstassuming deterministic behavior of Web services, then requiringthe additional overhead of execution monitoringto recover from unexpected behavior of services. To addressthese concerns, we propose using Markov decisionprocesses (MDPs), to model workflow composition. Ourmethod models both, the inherent stochastic nature of Webservices, and the dynamic nature of the environment. The resultingworkflows are robust to non-deterministic behaviorsof Web services and adaptive to a changing environment.Using an example scenario, we demonstrate our methodand provide empirical results in its support.
