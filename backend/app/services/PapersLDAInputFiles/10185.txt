Semantic View for Grid Services.The Grid technology is expected to have the ability of resolving the problem of large-scale information resources sharing in virtual organizations, which deliver a number of Grid Services to publish large-scale information to end-users. In this paper, we propose an intelligent client to Grid Services, which manipulate information resources at semantic level and provides end-users with a universal and intuitive semantic view for various Grid Services. With a series of semantic plug-ins in Semantic Browser, end-users can gain richer interaction with Grid Services and resolve complex domain problems in a more intuitive and friendly environment.
