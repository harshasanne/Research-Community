Decomposition and Abstraction of Web Applications for Web Service Extraction and Composition.There are large demands for re-engineering humanoriented Web application systems for use as machineoriented Web application systems, which are called Web Services. This paper describes a framework named H2W, which can be used for constructing Web Service wrappers from existing, multi-paged Web applications. H2Ws contribution is mainly for service extraction, rather than for the widely studied problem of data extraction. For the framework, we propose a page-transition- based decomposition model and a page access abstraction model with context propagation. With the proposed decomposition and abstraction, developers can flexibly compose a Web Service wrapper oftheir intent by describing a simple worwow program incorporating the advantages of previous work on Web data extraction. We show three successful wrapper application examples with H2 W for real world Web applications.
