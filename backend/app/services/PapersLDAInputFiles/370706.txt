Reputation = f(User Ranking Compliance Verity).The selection of web services is typically based on bothfunctional and non-functional attributes of the service, such asthe Quality of Service (QoS) levels. Reputation, a widelyacknowledged non-functional QoS attribute is currentlyexpressed as the average of user ratings given to the service.However, this expression confines reputation to the subjectiveperception of the end user and is limited by the lack of anobjective representation of performance history. In this paper,we address the need for a reputation mechanism that couplesthe subjective perception of the end user with the objectiveview of performance history. To represent performance history,we propose a novel QoS metric termed verity. Verity measuresthe degree of consistency exhibited by the service provider indelivering the quality levels laid out in the service contract,over a range of previous transactions. We express reputationas a composition of user rating, the compliance levels exhibitedby the provider and the verity value. We contend that thisreputation expression is a more viable attribute of quality thanuser rating alone.
