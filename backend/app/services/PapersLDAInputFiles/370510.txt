Web Service Management Using System Dynamics.Web Service provides a means to integrate functional componentsand for business IT solutions in an enterprise or cross-enterpriseenvironment. Enterprise resources are consumed by Web Servicesto provide desired capabilities expected by the users. However, beyondservice provisioning, an enterprise needs to manage their Web servicesand related resources in an optimal manner in order to maximize theresource usage. This paper presents a framework of Web servicemanagement aimed for solving the resource allocation issues basedon System Dynamics models. Our approach combines the businessoperational consideration and IT infrastructure configuration. Dependencythat is derived from impact analysis of different perspectives is an essentialpart of the model and can be built into control system. The resultantsystem embodies the capability of autonomic Web service managementto certain degree if not fully. The reference architecture of this frameworkis accounted in this paper. We also demonstrate dynamical behavior of the system through simulation.
