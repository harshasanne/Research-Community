A Semantic Approach for Designing E-Business Protocols.Business processes involve interactions among autonomouspartners. We propose that these interactions be specifiedmodularly as protocols. Protocols can be published, enablingimplementors to independently develop components that respectpublished protocols and yet serve diverse interests. A varietyof business protocols would be needed to capture subtle businessneeds. We propose that the same kinds of conceptual abstractionsbe developed for protocols as for information models. Specifically,we consider (1) refinement: a subprotocol may satisfy the requirementsof a superprotocol, but support additional properties; and(2) aggregation: a protocol may combine existing protocols. Insupport of the above, this paper develops a semantics of protocolsand an operational characterization of them. This supports judgmentsabout the potential subclass-superclass relations betweenprotocols, which are a result of protocol refinement. It alsoenables protocol aggregation by splicing a protocol into another protocol.
