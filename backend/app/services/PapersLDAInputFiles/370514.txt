Modeling Quantifying and Testing Complex Aggregate Service Chains.Service chaining, the act of stringing a sequence of services togetherto form a new service, is a key element of web services. However, forweb services to reach its full potential the issue of testing service- chaining at the network level must be resolved. How can one map themicro-level service-service interactions to the macro-level systemperformance? For instance, as service chains become longer and morecomplex, how do they affect end-user quality of service? Focusing onaggregate service chains.situations in which the user invokes a servicethat carries out the chain, without the user being aware of the individualservices.we tackle these questions using a Java simulation tool to modelservice chaining, visualize network traffic and quantify service chaincomplexity. We demonstrate that one can orchestrate very complexservice chains in a simple distributed manner and quantify how servicechain complexity affects end-user quality of service and network loading.
