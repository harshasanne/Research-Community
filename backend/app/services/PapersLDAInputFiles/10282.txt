Event-driven Dynamic Web Services Composition and Automation of Business Processes.B2B and long running B2C process are a complex business process that contains set of services, state, transaction management, and involve notification of events occur during the execution of process. Business processes are driven by events and evaluating the business processes at regional or national scale reveals diversity in products, terminology and processes involved in carrying out a complete business activity. Because of dynamic nature, heterogeneity and lack of knowledge among business partner there is a need of mechanism to compose services dynamically according to events, and to provide interoperable integration for automation of business process. We proposed convergence of semantic web, web services and grid computing to achieve context and location based interoperable integration, event-driven dynamic composition, scalable architecture and middleware support for state, transaction, notification and lifecycle management of business process.
