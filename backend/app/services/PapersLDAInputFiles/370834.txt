Situated Web Service: Context-Aware Approach to High-Speed Web Service Communication.A framework is proposed to improve Web Service performance based on context-aware communication. Two key ideas are introduced to represent a client context; (1) available protocols that the client can handle, and (2) operation usage that shows how the client uses Web Service operations. We call our context aware approach a Situated Web Service (SiWS). We implemented and evaluated the SiWS and found that the overall performance was improved if more than three Web Services were executed between context changes.
