Matchmaking for Business Processes Based on Choreographies.Web services have a potential to enhance B2B e-commerceover the Internet by allowing companies andorganizations to publish their business processes on servicedirectories where potential trading partners canfind them. This can give rise to new business paradigmsbased on ad-hoc trading relations as companies, particularlysmall to medium scale, can cheaply and flexiblyenter into fruitful contracts, e.g., through subcontractingfrom big companies by simply publishing their businessprocesses and the services they offer. More business processsupport by the web service infrastructure is howeverneeded before such a paradigm change can materialize.A service for searching and matchmaking of businessprocesses does not yet exist in the current infrastructure.We believe that such a service is needed and willenable companies and organizations to be able to establishad-hoc business relations without relying on manuallynegotiated interorganizational workflows. This papergives a formal semantics to business process matchmakingbased on finite state automata extended by logicalexpressions associated to states.
