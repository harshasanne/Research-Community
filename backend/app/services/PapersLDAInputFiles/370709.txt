A Novel Web Service for Presence and its Implementation in an IETF SIMPLE Protocol Environment.Presence technology conveys the willingness and ability of an entityto communicate and is very useful in developing innovative applications.Protocols and APIs have been proposed for presence, but theseAPIs are at a low level of abstraction. Web services provide the flexibility to develop loosely coupled applications with coarse-grainedinterfaces. This paper proposes a novel Web service for presenceapplication development. This Web service is presence protocolindependent and its use is illustrated in the paper by a concreteapplication. We have implemented it as a gateway towards an IETFSIMPLE based presence server, but other implementations are possible.The mapping is discussed and the prototype described. Performancemeasurements are also made. The results indicate that the additionaloverhead introduced because of XML-based SOAP messages is notprohibitive, although significant.
