Enhanced Transport Bindings for Efficient SOAP Messaging.Within the past years the web service technology emerged intomore and more fields of application. In some cases the classicalapproach of using HTTP as a transport binding for SOAP seemsno longer adequate. As a full scale application protocol HTTPcauses a high amount of protocol overhead and is too inflexible formany web service scenarios. In this paper we will initially give anin-depth review of existing transport bindings with a strong focus ondata rate efficiency. Then we will introduce an advanced UDPbinding called PURE that significantly reduces the protocol overheadand enables interesting additional features such as point-to-multipointcommunication via IP multicast and broadcast.
