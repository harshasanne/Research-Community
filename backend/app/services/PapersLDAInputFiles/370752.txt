A Generic Cost Model and Infrastructure for Improving Web Service Efficiency through Dynamic Relocation.The web service paradigm promotes the delivery of software as aservice via the web, instead of a product to end-users. The increasein assigned responsibilities for supporting organizational operationsdrives the needs for higher operational efficiencies (i.e. performanceand reliability) and flexibilities (i.e. customizations). This paper makestwo contributions. An infrastructure to support the development andoperation of customized cost model components, used to managecost efficiency and reliability issues. Secondly, a generic cost model algorithm that can be used as the foundation algorithm for cost modelcomponents. Further, the process of web service relocation is alsodemonstrated and implementation has also been discussed.
