Ensuring Quality of Services at Runtime A Case Study.Designing the Qualities of Services (QoS) and verifying their ensuring at runtime are key issues addressed by today information systems. In this paper, we present our solution to these issues through a case study related to the provisioning of media streaming services. Our approach is based on the main concepts of the Service Oriented Architecture and exploits the Service Level Agreements to express QoS and adaptive mechanisms to monitor and change QoS at runtime.
