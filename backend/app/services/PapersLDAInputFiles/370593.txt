IDSim: An Extensible Framework for Interoperable Distributed Simulation.We are developing an Interoperable DistributedSimulation (IDSim) framework that builds upon theOpen Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) to providedistributed simulation services to federated simulators.OGSI and web technology standards provide novelopportunities for a domain-independent, distributedsimulation framework to support extensibility by usersof the system. IDSim services can be extended throughinheritance to add or extend operations tailored to theneeds of specific simulation domains. XML-baseddocumentation of simulation models allows theframework to operate upon the contents of sharedevents (e.g., content-based distribution). Additionally,exposure of the underlying framework through GridWeb Services Description Language (GWSDL) allowsfor tool-based extensibility; that is, tools can bedeveloped to create and manage complex federations.This paper presents the design and architecture ofIDSim with a focus on extensibility; other designconcepts are presented where relevant.
