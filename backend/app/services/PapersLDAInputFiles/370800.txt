DAML-QoS Ontology for Web Services.As more and more Web services are deployed, Web service'sdiscovery mechanisms become essential. Similar services can havequite different QoS levels. For service selection and managementpurpose, it is necessary to explicitly, precisely, and unambiguouslyspecify various constraints and QoS metrics for Web services descriptions.This paper provides a novel DAML-QoS ontology as acomplement for DAML-S ontology to provide a better QoS metricsmodel. Three layers are defined together with clear role descriptionsfor developments. Cardinality constraints are utilizedto describe the QoS property constraints. Basic profile is presentedfor general web service's description and the speed startup of ontologydefinition. Matchmaking algorithm for QoS property constraintsis presented and different matching degrees are described.When incorporated with DAML-S, multiple service levels can bedescribed through attaching multiple QoS profiles to one serviceprofile. Well-defined Metrics can be further utilized by measurementorganizations to guarantee the promised service level.
