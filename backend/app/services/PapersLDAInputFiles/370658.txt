Conflictingrequirements towards the nature of these servicescan be identified. From a business perspective, Web Servicespromise to enable the formation of ad-hoc cooperation's ona global scale. From a technical perspective, a high degreeof standardization and rigorous specifications are requiredto enable the automated integration of Web Services. A suitabletechnology for Web Services has to mediate these needsfor flexibility and stability. In this paper, a new approach tothe description of Web Service semantics is introduced. It isa visual approach based on the use of software models andgraph transformations and allows for the description of innovativeservices while providing a precise matching concept.An implementation using current standards and toolsis available.
