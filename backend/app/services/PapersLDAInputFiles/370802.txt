A Robust Application-Level Approach for Responsiveness Differentiation.There is a growing demand for provisioning of proportional responsive- ness differentiation to various clients on scalable Web servers to meetchanging resource availability and to satisfy different client requirements.Theoretically, a queueing-based processing rate allocation scheme is able to achieve the objective by providing different processing rates to requestsof different client classes. However, in this paper, we find that an implement- ation of the queueingtheoretical scheme shows weak proportionality withlarge variance because it does not have fine-grained control over theconsumption of resources that the kernel consumes and hence theprocessing rate is not strictly proportional to the number of processesallocated. We design a feedback controller and integrate it with thequeueing theoretical scheme. The integrated application-level approach allocates a certain number of processes to handle requests of differentclient classes according to the queueing-theoretical scheme. Theprocess allocations are then adjusted according to the differencebetween the target response time and the achieved response time by using the proportional integral derivative control. Results demonstrate thatthis integrated approach can enable Web servers to provide fine-grainedresponse time differentiation. The approach is robust and can bepractically deployed on Apache Web servers.
