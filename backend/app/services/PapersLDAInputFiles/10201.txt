An Ontology Based Content Model for Web Services Description.Correctly described Web service will facilitate automatically discovery of web service in semantic web. In this paper, we present a content model for a better ontological metadata representation to facilitate Web service description. The proposed content model has two parts: content profile and process model. The content profile consists of three metadata, a core metadata, a structural metadata, and a semantic metadata, by which we can use to describe a Web service's basic properties, content structure and semantic meaning, respectively. The process model provide control construct to design complex service. We also provide a mechanism to transform a content model to a DAML-S Web service.
