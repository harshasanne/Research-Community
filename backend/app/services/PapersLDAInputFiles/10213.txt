WS-EPM: Web Services for Enterprise Project Management.This paper presents a new service-oriented architecture for enterprise project management that integrates business process, human resources and project management within an enterprise or across the value chain network. In the proposed WS-EPM framework, the project resources include business processes, skilled people, physical resources, control policies, and so forth. The project resources used in WS-EPM are described by WSResource properties language. In addition, the coordination of project resources is guided by a set of operations modeled by Business Process Execution Language for Web Services (BPEL4WS). At the end of this paper, we present an industry application scenario that leverages the proposed WS-EPM for achieving maximum ROI with limited resources.
