Integrating Behavioral Trust in Web Service Compositions.Algorithms for composing Web services (WS) traditionally utilize thefunctional andquality-of-service parameters ofcandidate servicesto decide which services to include in the composition.Users oftenhavediffering experienceswitha WS. Whiletrust ina WSismulti-faceted andconsists of security andbehavioral aspects, ourfocus in thispaper is on the latter.We adopta formal model fortrust in a WS, whichmeets many of our intuitions about trustworthyWSs.We hypothesizepredictors of a positive experiencewith a WSandconduct asmall pilotstudy toexplorecorrelations betweensubjects' experienceswith WSs ina composition andthe predictorvalues for those WSs.Furthermore,we show how we mayderivetrust for compositions from trust models of individual services.Weconclude by presenting and evaluating a novel framework, calledWisp, that utilizes the trust models and, in combination with anyWS composition tool, choosescompositions to deploy that are deemedmost trustworthy.
