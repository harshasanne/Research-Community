Fully Automated Web Services Orchestration in a Resource Retrieval Scenario.We propose a framework and polynomial algorithms for semantic-basedautomated Web service orchestration, fully compliant with SemanticWeb technologies. The approach exploits the recently proposedConcept Abduction inference service in Description Logics to solve Concept Covering problems. We present how the proposed approachdeals with not exact solutions, computing an approximate orchestration with respect to an agent request modeled using a significant subset ofOWL-DL.
