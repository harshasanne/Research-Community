Compatibility Verification for Web Service Choreography.In this paper we discuss a model-based approach toverifying process interactions for coordinated webservice compositions. The approach uses finite statemachine representations of web service orchestrationsand assigns semantics to the distributed processinteractions. The move towards implementing webservice compositions by multiple interested parties as aform of distributed system architecture motivates theneed for supporting compatibility verification ofactivities and transactions in all the processes. Thedescribed approach is supported by a suite ofcooperating tools for specification, formal modeling andproviding verification results from orchestrated webservice interactions.
