Evaluation and Modeling of Web Services Performance.While web services have been widely accepted as a platform-independent services-oriented technology, its performance remains a concern due to the verbosity and inefficiency inherent from using text-based XML. This paper presents a study of web services performance by evaluating the current implementations of web services and comparing them with a number of alternative technologies. This study gives a picture of the current web services performance behaviors and develops a simple performance model that can be used to estimate web services latencies.
