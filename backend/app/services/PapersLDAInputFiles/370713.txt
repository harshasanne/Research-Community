Combining Query and Preference - An Approach to Fully Automatize Dynamic Service Binding.Web services will only have advantages over existing technologies if the service binding can be performed dynamically. However, existing service description languages do not contain enough information for a computer agent to do the selection automatically during runtime onbehalf of the user. This results from the fact that in mostapproaches the offer description language doubles as a request language,which prevents the requestor from a precise formulation of requests and preferences. Therefore, in this paper, we emphasize the need for a distinguishedservice request language that allows to capture all of therequestor's preferences. We present a concrete techniqueto represent such preference-containing requests, whichis based on fuzzy object sets.
