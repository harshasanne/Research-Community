SRN: An Extended Petri-Net-Based Workflow Model for Web Service Composition.The emergence of Web services has led to moreinterest into Web service composition, which is anactive area of research. The formidable problem ofefficient and effective composition of existing Webservices is the subject of much current attention. Thestudy of workflow model is one of the most importantparts and a key layer of Web service composition. Theexisting approaches have difficulties in modelingdynamic and complex service composition process, sowe propose a novel workflow model namedService/Resource Net (SRN) for Web servicecomposition, which is an extended Petri-net-basedmodel with some new elements, such as time, resourcetaxonomy, condition, etc. To establish formal conceptsystem of Web service taxonomy in SRN, we presentWeb service semigroup based on group theory.Moreover, meta-service is proposed based on thedefinition of generating element in cyclic monoid. Asthe supplement of traditional analysis methods of basicPetri net, some new methods based on graph theoryare presented for SRN analyzing and evaluating. Forsystem and methodology validation purpose, SRN isapplied to a case study in our research project.
