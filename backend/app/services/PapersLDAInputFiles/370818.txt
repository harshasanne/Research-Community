Partner and Service Discovery for Collaboration Establishment with Semantic Web Services.The ultimate goal of the Semantic Web is to enable automatedcollaboration over the Internet, based on ontologies as semanticterminology definitions and Web Services as computational facilitiesaccessible over the Web. An essential functionality for collaboration support on the Semantic Web is detection of entities, services, andother resources that are to be used for achieving a successfulcollaboration. This is commonly referred to as discovery, wherefore theemerging concept of Semantic Web Services promises more effective support than conventional Web Service technologies: based on exhaustive semantic description frameworks, intelligentmechanisms are envisioned for discovery, composition, and contractingof Web Services. This paper outlines an approach for automated collaboration support using Semantic Web Services, and presentsthe realization of semantically driven discovery of cooperation partnersand usable Web Services as a main component for collaborationestablishment.
