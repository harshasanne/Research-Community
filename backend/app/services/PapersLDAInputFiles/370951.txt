Service-Oriented Order-to-Cash Solution with Business RSS Information Exchange Framework.For period of time customers have demand for more reusable and manageable service-oriented components for Order-to-Cash (O2C) solution so they can be easily re-configured and managed to adapt to business changes quickly. In this paper, we present a serviceoriented business process optimization model that minimizes potential revenue leakage through process improvements. We introduce service componentization approach to decompose business processes to identify re-usable services in SOA solution context. We adopt Really-Simple-Syndication (RSS) technology to realize a collaborative dispute management solution based on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The proposed approach can help streamline the dispute management process with revenue increase and higher customer satisfaction.
