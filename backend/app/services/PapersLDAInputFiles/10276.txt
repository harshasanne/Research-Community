Using Data Semantics to Enable Automatic Composition of Web Services.This paper demonstrates the automatic creation of a web service that chains together existing web services to achieve a particular goal. The generated service implements the necessary workflows to convert an instance data of one system into an instance data of another. This paper further demonstrates the reconciliation of structural, syntactic, and representational mismatches between the input instance and the desired output instance.
