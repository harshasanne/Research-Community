Realizability of Conversation Protocols With Message Contents.A conversation protocol is a top-down specificationframework which specifies desired global behaviorsof a web service composition. In our earlier work [A formalism for specification and verification of reactive electronic services]we studied the problem of realizability, i.e., given a conversationprotocol, can a web service composition besynthesized to generate behaviors as specified by the protocol.Several sufficient realizability conditions were proposedin [A formalism for specification and verification of reactive electronic services] to ensure realizability. Conversation protocolsstudied in [A formalism for specification and verification of reactive electronic services], however, are essentially abstract controlflows without data semantics. This paper extends thework in [A formalism for specification and verification of reactive electronic services] and achieves more accurate analysis by consideringdata semantics. To overcome the state-spaceexplosion caused by the data content, we propose a symbolicanalysis technique for each realizability condition.In addition, we show that the analysis of the autonomycondition can be done using an iterative refinement approach.
