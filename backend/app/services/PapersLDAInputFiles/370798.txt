An Adaptive Process Allocation Strategy for Proportional Responsiveness Differentiation on Web Servers.There is a growing demand for provisioning of differentlevels of quality of service (QoS) on scalable Web serversto meet changing resource availability and satisfy differentclient requirements. The proportional differentiation modelis getting momentum because of its fairness and differentiationpredictability. It states that QoS of different trafficclasses should be kept proportional to their pre-specifieddifferentiation parameters, independent of the class loads.In this paper, we present a processing rate allocationscheme for providing proportional response time differentiationon Web servers. A challenging issue is how to achieveprocessing rates for different request classes in the implementation.We propose a process allocation strategy, whichdynamically and adaptively changes the number of processesallocated for handling different request classes whileensuring the ratios of process allocation specified by theprocessing rate allocation scheme. We implement the processallocation strategy at application level on Apache Webservers. Experimental results show that the processing ratecan be achieved by the adaptive process allocation strategyand the Web servers can provide predictable and controllableproportional response time differentiation.
