Web Services Automatic Composition with Minimal Execution Price.Web services composition has gained a considerable momentumas a means to create and streamline business-to-businesscollaborations within and across organizational boundaries.The composition approach proposed in this paper can enable user togenerate a composite web service with minimal execution pricedynamically. After modeling Web services with rules and eliminatingsemantics conflicts among parameters of Web service models, we can compute a deduced network with inputs given by user. Basedon the deduced network, a set of composition plans for every outputcan be obtained with a backward deduction approach. In order to get the composition plan which has the minimal execution price, all theoutput's composition plan sets should be joined by Cartesian product.
