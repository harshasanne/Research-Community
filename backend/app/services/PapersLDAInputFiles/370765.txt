WSIP - Web Service SIP Endpoint for Converged Multimedia/Multimodal Communication over IP.We present an approach for converged communicationservices over IP, based on the concept of WSIP (WebService SIP). In our approach, each WSIP node is botha SIP endpoint that communicates in the SIP worldthrough SIP signaling, and a web service SOAP nodethat provides a native and generic service integrationenvironment for binding SIP based communication inweb services. The unification of SIP with web serviceprovides a new converged communication paradigm. Itallows dynamic service discovery and binding thatintegrate SIP as a component in the businesstransaction. The clear separation of service integrationenvironment and SIP signaling in our approachmaintains the simplicity and efficiency of the existingSIP protocol, while leverages the power of bothmethods in IP based communication services. Theubiquitous service integration nature of web serviceprovides a disciplined solution to maintain and updatelarge number of SIP endpoints from differentinstallation bases. It enables dynamic monitoring,repairing, and updating SIP UA endpoints, which isessential to the success of VoIP using SIP. Theproposed approach was implemented in a prototyperesearch system, and several advantages of WSIP overthe existing approaches are observed.
