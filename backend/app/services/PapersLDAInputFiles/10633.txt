Query Evaluation and Performance Optimization in Distributed Community Data Sharing System Based on Web Services.Community data sharing is an emerging paradigm of data sharing. Web Services can be used in distributed community data sharing system to share data between communities resized in different nodes. We implement a community data sharing system based on Web Services, Honeycomb. In Honeycomb, Web Services invocation is the main performance bottleneck of query execution and cache technique is utilized to improve query performance. This paper describes the query evaluation, cache design and implementation in Honeycomb.
