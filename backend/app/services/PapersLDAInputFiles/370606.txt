A Non-Invasive Approach to Dynamic Web Services Provisioning.Service-oriented computing has emerged as a new component-basedsoftware development paradigm in a network-centric environment. Byusing a standard description language and protocol, services can beused to wrap legacy software systems to be integrated beyond theenterprise boundary across heterogeneous platforms. Nevertheless, thechallenges come in tandem with the opportunities because of the inherentdynamic characteristics within a distributed environment. In particular,there is a need for dynamic adaptation for provisioned services toaccommodate the ever-changing business requirements externally as wellas the computing resource status internally, while maintaining thecontinuousness of service provisioning. We present a dynamic WebService provisioning approach based on .NET Common Language Runtime,one of the two primary Web Services platforms, exploring the runtime codemanipulation at the Intermediate Language (IL) level rather than at thesource code level. Meanwhile, we show how the service provisioning canbe adapted in a modularized way by complementing the conventionalService-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with a repository of adaptationaspects. Moreover, we demonstrate how dynamic service provisioningcan be used for non-functional property assurance.
