Autonomic Execution of Web Service Compositions.An increasing amount of Web services are being implemented using process management tools and languages (BPML, BPEL, etc.). The main advantage of processes is that designers canexpress complex business conversations at a high level ofabstraction, even reusing standardized business protocols. Thedownside is that the infrastructure behind the Web service becomesmore complex. This is particularly critical for Web services that may be subjected to high variability in demand and suffer from unpredictable peaks of heavy load. In this paper we present a flexible architecture for process execution that has been designed to support autonomicscalability. The system runs on a cluster of computers and reacts toworkload variations by altering its configuration in order to optimallyuse the available resources. Such changes happen automaticallyand without any human intervention. This feature completely removesthe need for the manual monitoring and reconfiguration of the system,which in practice is a difficult and time-consuming operation. In thepaper we describe the architecture of the system and present anextensive performance evaluation of its autonomic capabilities.
