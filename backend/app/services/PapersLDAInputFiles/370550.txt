How to Bridge the Last Gap of Detail for a Complete Integration of Web Services into Users' Tasks.With the Semantic Web and Web Services we have potentialtechnologies to develop architectures that support the broadintegration of business processes. A growing number of standardslike BPEL1 or WSCI2 enable us to develop integrated businessprocess architectures on a corporate as well as on an industrywide level. Service-oriented architectures (SOA) permit us to developnew generations of integrated business applications from reusablecomponents and along structures that represent mundane aswell as sophisticated business processes. However, experiencesin business process modeling show that developing Web servicesand the corresponding orchestration layer is quite challenging. Thecoexistence of Semantic Web standards and natural language couldhelp to lower the language barrier in design and orchestration, allowingeven non-tech people to be involved in application design. Translatingnatural language descriptions into the semantics of the respectiveSOA can help to facilitate and fasten the design process.
