Dynamic Invocation Model of Web Services Using Subsumption Relations.Enterprise information systems are currently developedas Web-based applications in the service-oriented architecturestyle, which is implied by the stack of Web services standards.One of the most critical aspects in enterprise informationsystems is to maintain their continuous operation aslong as possible. Conventional service invocation mechanismidentifies Web services with similar signatures foundby a service discovery as distinctively different ones, resultingin the suspension of a service requester and the modificationof its invocation procedures. In this paper, we proposea reasonable solution to realize runtime invocationof Web services, regarding structural similarities in servicesignatures as subsumption relations of XML scheme.Given Web services with subsumed signatures, this solutionenables a service requester to invoke the Web services bytranslating the scheme types of the invocation parameters.
