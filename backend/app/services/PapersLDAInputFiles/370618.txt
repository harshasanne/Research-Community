Efficient Model-Driven Service Brokering using Web Services.Web services are rapidly becoming the technology ofchoice for integrating distributed application componentsin heterogeneous computing environments. In this paper,we present a novel e-commerce prototype application thatitself would not be feasible without the leverage providedby underlying Web services technologies for flexible designand rapid prototyping. The application is a Model-drivenService Brokerage that allows service providers to model,advertise, validate, and create a wide range of services(e.g. Internet access services such as DSL, and Cable,Video-on-demand, etc) in an open marketplace in anautomated fashion. The application answers real needsexpressed by today's large Service Providers and goesbeyond the current state-of-the-art in onlinecommunication marketplaces. It consists of severalfunctional components - i.e. a service dependency modelingtool, brokerage engine, location services, and workflowengine - that have been independently developed on diverseplatforms, e.g., J2EE, .NET. To efficiently integrate thesecomponents, we have designed a distributed Web servicesarchitecture, in which one Web Service functions as a"hub" between previously disconnected components,another works as a "wrapper" of legacy data systems,while another "orchestrates" invocations of these services.Use of Web services has enabled parallel and independentdevelopment and testing, greatly increasing productivityand reducing time to get the system operational. It hasalso fostered the development of new Brokerage features,which would have been difficult to plan without firstexperimenting with a "live" system.
