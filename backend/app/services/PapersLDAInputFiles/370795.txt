A QoS Broker Based Architecture for Efficient Web Services Selection.Quality of Service (QoS) support in web services plays a great rolefor the success of this emerging technology. In this paper, wepresent a QoS brokerbased architecture for web services. Themain goal of the architecture is to support the client in selecting web services based on his/her required QoS. To achieve this goal,we propose a two-phase verification technique that is performed bya third party broker. The first phase consists of syntactic and semantic verification of the service interface description including the QoSparameters description. The second phase consists of applying ameasurement technique to compute the QoS metrics stated in theservice interface and compares their values with the claimed one.This is used to verify the conformity of a web service from the QoSpoint of view (QoS testing). A methodological approach to generateQoS test cases, as input to QoS verification is used. We haveimplemented a prototype that includes the verification and certification components of the broker. We performed experiments to evaluatethe importance of verification and certification features in the selectionprocess using real web services.
