Anonymizing Web Services through a Club Mechanism with Economic Incentives.Preserving privacy during Web transactions is amajor concern for individuals and organizations. One ofthe solutions proposed in the literature is to maintain anonymitythrough group cooperation during Web transactions.The lack of understanding of incentives for encouraginggroup cooperation is a major drawback in such systems.We propose an anonymizing club mechanism, andsequential economic strategy for trusted collaboration. Wemodel the individual transactions as a Prisoners' Dilemma,where two players either cooperate or defect whilemaintaining each other's anonymity. The activities of theparticipants over a series of transactions can be modeledas a sequential repeated game. We determine conditions toensure cooperation among the participants in the sequentialrepeated game, even if defecting is a dominant strategyin each individual Prisoners' Dilemma game. Our resultsshow that by adopting an appropriate initiation fee andadequate fine for malicious behavior, both enforcedthrough a trusted central authority, we can sustain cooperationin the proposed anonymizing club mechanism.
