i2Map: An Approach to Model the Landscape of Federated Systems.The rapid advance of technologies like Web services enablessolutions to exploit more and more of the potential of the Webin many ways, recently especially in the field of federating distributedsystems within or between businesses. To sustain maintainability andcope with the evolving application life cycles, a global uniform view on all involved sub systems and underlying infrastructure is required. Thiscan be provided by a model that serves as a map for the landscapeof the overall system to act as a guide to evolution. In this paper, weintroduce the i2Map as an approach to these modeling demandsfocused on federable Web-service-based applications.
