Net Traveler: A Framework for Autonomic Web Services Collaboration Orchestration and Choreography in E-Government Information Systems.Next-generation Government Information Systems willintegrate large amounts of heterogeneous data sourceslocated on distributed networks like the Internet. Wepresent Net Traveler which is a framework for webservices collaboration, orchestration and choreographyin peer-to-peer autonomic environments. The mainfeature of our new approach is the elimination of acentral coordination site running the queries and theautonomic query execution. Moreover, controlinformation is embedded with the request for data, andalso with the partial results in an XML document. ThisXML document indicates the next service to be requested,the target site (if known) and how should it process anypartial results. We present the architecture, the ideasbehind it, a prototype, and a performance study tovalidate this framework. This study shows this frameworkto be flexible, scalable and efficient for the web servicescollaboration in electronic government applications.
