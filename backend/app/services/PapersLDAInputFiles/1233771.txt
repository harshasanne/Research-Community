Business Entities: An SOA Approach to Progressive Core Banking Renovation.The challenges in banking industry are forcing banks torenovate their core systems to survive fierce competition.A progressive renovation approach is preferable to totalreplacement because it is less intrusive and risky. In thispaper, we present an incremental core bankingrenovation methodology based on the concept of businessentities. We implemented this methodology to develop anSOA solution to dynamic product bundling for an Asianbank. This renovation project provided an opportunity forus to explore SOA design principles regarding servicecomponent modularity, service reusability, changemanagement and integration, and also to empiricallydemonstrate the advantages of the business entity-centricapproach in achieving well-designed SOA solutions.
