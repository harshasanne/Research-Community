Performance Impact of Web Service Migration in Embedded Environments.The benefits provided by Web Service protocols are well recognized.Deployments to date, however, have concentrated on new applications,and existing Web-based applications. A host of legacy applications andprotocols continue to exist in their native forms, outdated, yet entrenched due to large installed bases. This paper details our observations inintegrating a Web Service infrastructure into the Simple NetworkManagement Protocol (SNMP). SNMP has been in use for over adecade and a half, predominantly in network equipment embeddedsystems. Our Web Servicebased approach allows us to enhance ourexisting application with XML/SOAP interoperability, SSL/TLS security, and the potential to migrate both application and protocol layers toencompass future extensions and Web browser accessibility. The difficultywith SNMP, and many other legacy networking protocols, is that muchof the extensive installed base is hosted on limited capability, legacyhardware. While the benefits of our scheme are quite tangible, theperformance impact of adding these features is not well known. Weexamine two approaches, an integrated solution using a light-weightHTTP/SOAP stack, as well as a standard Java Web serverimplementation. Our tests reveal unanticipated performance resultsthrough both the integrated and proxy methods. We discuss the impactof these anomalies on the viability of our approach and address thebroad issue of migrating Web Services to legacy embedded architectures.
