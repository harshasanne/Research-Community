A Framework for Collaborative Product Commerce using Web Services.This paper presents a novel web-based service-orientedframework to support collaborative productcommerce. The framework coordinates processes todesign and manufacture a product in a loosely coupledenvironment using Web services. We have developed aservice model using OWL. It provides facilities forcompanies to discover services that other companiesprovide. Choreography of Web services is achievedusing the process grammar. Usage of ProcessGrammar helps to configure processes dynamically,facilitating collaboration among companies. Theframework, therefore, provides a truly distributedarchitecture for management of service compositionand inter-operation, lending a unique functionality tothe framework.
