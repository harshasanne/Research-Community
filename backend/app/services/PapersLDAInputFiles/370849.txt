A Model-Driven Approach for Specifying Semantic Web Services.The semantic web promises automated invocation, discovery, andcomposition of web services by enhancing services with semanticdescriptions. One such language used for creating semantic descriptionsis the Web Ontology Language or OWL. An upper ontology for webservices called OWL-S has been created to provide a mechanismfor describing service semantics in a standard, well-defined manner. Unfortunately, the learning curve for semantic-rich description languages such as OWL-S can be steep, especially with given thecurrent state of tool support for the language. This paper describesan automated software tool that uses model-driven architecture (MDA)techniques to generate an OWL-S description of a web service froma UML model. This allows the developer to focus on creating a model of the web service in a standard UML tool, leveraging existing knowledge.
