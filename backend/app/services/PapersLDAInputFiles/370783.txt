Validating Compositions of Geospatial Processing Web Services in a Scientific Workflow Environment.Geospatial processing often involves complex and complicated geospatial data types. It is extremely inefficient if not infeasible to require scientistusers maintain type compatibility of the ports of Web services that areconnecting to each other. This study proposes to extend the typechecking system of Kepler scientific workflow system to help scientistusers composite geospatial Web services more effectively.
