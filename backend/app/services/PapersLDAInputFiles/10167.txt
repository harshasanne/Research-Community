P2P Grid: Service Oriented Framework for Distributed Resource Management.With the increasing number of computers on the Internet, there is a growing interest in harnessing the unused and inexpensive computational resources over the Internet. However, current approaches such as the Grid computing paradigm are not sufficient. We present our preliminary work that uses extends Peer-2- Peer (P2P) computing with a framework that allows Grid computing over the internet.
