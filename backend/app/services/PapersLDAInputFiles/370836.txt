Taming Web Services in the Wild.Service-oriented computing (SOC) enables organizations and individual users to discover openlyaccessible capabilities realized as services over the Internet. Research in this area focuses on techniques for managing the messages that flow into and out of these services to ultimately compose higher-level functions. In our work, we investigate the nature of message definitions by analyzing real, fully-operational web services currently available on the Internet (i.e., from the wild). By leveraging insights into how real web service messages are defined, we develop enhanced syntactical methods to best aggregate these messages and ultimately the web services.
