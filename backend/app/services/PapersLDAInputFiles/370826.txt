Comparison of UDDI Registry Replication Strategies.UDDI registries are intended to become the world-widelookup mechanism for web-services. As such, the registryhas to provide high throughput, low response times, highavailability, and access to accurate data. Replication is oftenused to satisfy such requirements. Various replicationstrategies exist, favoring different subsets of the above performancemetrics. In this paper, we have a closer look attwo very different replication strategies. One strategy followsthe UDDI speciï¿½cation, the second uses a middlewarebased replication tool. In this paper, we provide a comparisonof these two approaches focusing on performance andease of integration with an existing UDDI implementation.
