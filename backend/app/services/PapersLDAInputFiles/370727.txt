Provisioning Resilient Adaptive Web Services-based Workflow: A Semantic Modeling Approach.Web Services are emerging technologies that enableapplication-to-application communication andreuse of autonomous services over the Web. Recent efforts,OWL-S, model the semantics of Web Services thatincludes the capabilities of the service, the service interactionprotocol, and the actual messages for serviceexchanges. However, there is a need to automate discovery,selection and execution of OWL-S services. Further, aframework that meets the quality of service (QoS) requirementsfor ad hoc Internet based services is rarely provided.In this paper, we have proposed a rule-based framework,called SemWebQ, which manages workflows composedof Semantic Web Services. SemWebQ is capable ofconducting QoS-based adaptive selection as well as dynamicbinding and execution of Web Services accordingto the semantics of workflow, thereby rendering a resilientand adaptive Web based service flow. A series ofexperiments performed on the SemWebQ with real Web Serviceshave confirmed the effectiveness of proposed frameworkwith respect to adaptive selection and execution ofthe Web Services in Web based workflows.
