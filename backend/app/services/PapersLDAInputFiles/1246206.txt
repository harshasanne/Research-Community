Service Composition as Generative Constraint Satisfaction.The ability to build new (complex) services by composing existingservices is one of the key benefits of the Service Oriented Architectureparadigm. Existing approaches to automate composition requirespre-planning or prediction of the number of required services, makingthem unsuitable in dynamic composition scenarios. To address this gap, wepresent a consistency-based service composition approach, wherecomposition problems are modeled in a generative constraint-basedformalism. We illustrate how the configuration of service processesdiffers from established constraint-based configuration techniques anddevelop an algorithm to synthesis valid service process compositions. Wealso show that our technique scales well to non-trivial problems.
