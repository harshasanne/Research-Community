Optimizing Web Services Performance by Differential Deserialization.Web services technology has emerged as a key infrastructurethat enables business entities to interact with each other withoutany human inventions. In order for the technology to be widelyused, especially in any field where a large volume of transactionsmay be processed, it is highly desirable that the Web services engineshould tolerate such environments. In this paper, we present a novelapproach for improving Web services performance. We first focus on the fundamental characteristics of the Web services in that the SOAPmessages on the wire are mostly generated by machines and have alot of similarities among the processed messages. By making use ofthese features and eliminating the redundant processing, we propose a new deserialization mechanism that reuses matching regions fromthe previously deserialized application objects from earlier messages,and only performs deserialization for a new region that would not be processed before. Through our experiments in this paper, we observedthat our approach obtained a 288% performance gain (maximum) byincorporating the differential deserialization into the Axis SOAP engine.
