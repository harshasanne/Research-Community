An SOA Compass for Next Generation Networks.Next Generation Networks (NGNs) are faced with a perennial problem of adding newer services at a very short time period, and with very high levels of quality, and this has really made them think of innovative solutions to quickly adapt to the situation. It is imperative that the NGN service providers consider and use Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and its principles to achieve business goals and optimize longterm capital investment without compromising customer experience. We have studied the current problems faced by NGN Service Providers, and arrived at an innovative solution based on mathematical model to assist the Next Generation Network (NGN) service providers to use quantitative metrics to reach higher levels of service orientation. In addition, this methodology can be used to measure and optimize every investment made towards SOA alignment. Also, this methodology can be used to perform "what-if" analysis, in order to assess the impact of the business decisions without actually implementing those decisions.
