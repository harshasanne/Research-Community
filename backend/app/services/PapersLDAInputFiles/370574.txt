Supporting Adaptive Web-Service Orchestration with an Agent Conversation Framework.Service-oriented architecture is emerging as a compelling paradigmfor developing web-based software applications. In this style, thefunctional components of the system are implemented in variousprogramming languages as network-accessible "services"declaratively specified (in WSDL) and declaratively composed in workflows (using BPEL4WS). Despite this fundamentally distributedconceptualization of service composition, most current middlewareassumes that the specification of the service composition is interpretedat run time by a central middleware node. This implies inflexiblecomposition evolution: all parties must be updated concurrently to avoid interaction failures. This paper introduces an intelligent-agentframework that wraps web services in a conversation layer and iscapable of a simple workflowadaptation function. The conversationlayer implements protocols and consults globally shared, declarativepolicy specifications to resolve conversation failures. Two case studies illustrate this approach.
