IRIS: A Framework for Mediator-Based Composition of Service-Oriented Software.Due to a rapidly increasing volume of information andautonomous services, domain experts spend considerabletime and effort in correlating and integrating these resourcesinto meaningful business processes. In this paperwe present IRIS, a framework that effectively supportsusers in creating service compositions with the special focuson interoperability. We illustrate our work by means ofa scientific business process from the area of life scienceinformatics. For the sake of adaptability and reusabilityour approach relies on a component-based mediator model.The problem of mediator discovery and composition is addressedby an ontology-based registry approach.
