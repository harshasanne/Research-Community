Beyond Web Services: Towards On-Demand Complex Adaptive Environments.Complex adaptive systems are dynamically assembled systemscharacterized by multiple competing stakeholders, fluid requirements,emergent behavior, and susceptibility to external pressures that cancause change across the entire system. This paper shows how key principles of complex systems engineering can support achievingnet centric operations (NCO) for the DoD. We discuss approaches toon-demand data, an IT infrastructure strategy based on web serviceand semantic web technologies, as well as guidance and initial observations on spiral development and management usingCommunities of Interest combined with a Developerï¿½_s Environment.
