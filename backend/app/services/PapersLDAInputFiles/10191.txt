Ontology-based Information Retrieval of Web Services in Virtual Enterprise.Today, the virtual enterprise (VE), which joints many enterprises in order to share their costs, skills and resources in supporting certain goal, is playing an important role in e-commerce. In a VE, how information is shared among participants is a difficult problem. The emergence of Web services provides us with a new thought to resolve it. In this paper, we propose a framework of Web services based Intranet in VE (WIVE). Its focus is on the idea of information retrieval based on ontology. By the use of ontology and agent technology, we bring semantics to the Web services in VE intranet and improve the correctness of information retrieval.
