SecureSOA.This article discusses several aspects of design and test methodology centered on digital microfluidics, including modeling, simulation, synthesis, test, and reconfiguration. The automated design methods for digital electronics and adaption of them to droplet-based microfluidics are explained. The test methodology detects both catastrophic and parametric faults by electrically controlling and tracking the motion of the test stimuli droplets and also facilitates concurrent testing, in which fault testing and biomedical assays run simultaneously on a microfluidic system.
