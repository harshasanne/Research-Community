Large Scale Type-Compatible Service Composition.Service matchmaking and composition has recentlydrawn increasing attention in the research community.Most existing algorithms construct chains of servicesbased on exact matches of input/output types. However,this does not work when the available services onlycover a part of the range of the input type. We present an algorithmthat also allows partial matches and composesthem using switches that decide on the required serviceat runtime based on the actual data type. We report experimentson randomly generated composition problemsthat show that using partial matches can decrease the failurerate of the integration algorithm using only completematches by up to 7 times with no increase in the numberof directory accesses required. This shows that compositionwith partial matches is an essential and usefulelement of web service composition.
