Web Content Consistency Through Explicit Ownership Definition.In this paper, we would like to address the consistency problem for web content presentation through explicit ownership schemes. Our previous study [1] showed that for most content service networks, consistency problem arises because of the mis-matching of objects' attributes and pervasive contents. Our solution covers both protocols and supports for most of the necessary functions such as validation, delegation, presentation, etc. that need to be done in the network.
