A Small Listener for Heterogeneous Mobile Devices: A Service Enabler with a Uniform Web Object View.We recently developed "System on Mobile Devices"(SyD) middlewarefor rapidly developing and deploying collaborative distributed applicationsover a collection of autonomous web objects and data-stores, independent of the underlying device, data, or network. SyDListeneris a key component of SyD middleware. SyDListener provides a setof interfaces and classes that allows distributed SyD-based application components to communicate seamlessly in mobile environments.SyDListener provides a uniform object view of the underlying serverapplication and enables client applications to remotely invoke thosemethods using XML messages. SyDListener is implemented as a multi-threaded wrapper with simple persistence management andasynchronous invocation functionality for J2ME Mobile InformationDevice Profile (MIDP) on Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDL)devices. We discuss the functionality, architecture, implementation, and performance of SyDListener. We believe it is the first comprehensiveworking prototype of its kind for Java enabled handhelds with a smallfootprint of 10 KB.
