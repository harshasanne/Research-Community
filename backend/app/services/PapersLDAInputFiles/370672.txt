Towards Standardized Web Services Privacy Technologies.A Web service is defined as an autonomous unit ofapplication logic that provides either some businessfunctionality or information to other applications throughan Internet connection. Web services are based on a set ofXML standards such as Universal Description, Discoveryand Integration (UDDI), Web Services DescriptionLanguage (WSDL), and Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP). Recently there are increasing demands anddiscussions about Web services privacy technologies inthe industry and research community. In general, privacypolicies describe an organization's data practices whatinformation they collect from individuals (e.g., consumers)and what (e.g., purposes) they do with it. To enableprivacy protection for Web service consumers acrossmultiple domains and services, the World Wide WebConsortium (W3C) published a document called "WebServices Architecture (WSA) Requirements" that definessome specific privacy requirements for Web services as afuture research topic. At this moment, there is still nostandardized Web services privacy technology. This paperbriefly overviews the research issues of Web servicesprivacy technologies.
