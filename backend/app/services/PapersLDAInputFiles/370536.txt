Semantics Based Verification and Synthesis of BPEL4WS Abstract Processes.We introduce a logic model to formally specify the semanticsof workflows and their composite tasks describedas BPEL4WS abstract processes. Based on the model, wepresent a set of inference rules to deduce the strongestpostcondition and weakest precondition of a workflow anddemonstrate that automatic workflow verification is possibledue to the restrictions on data manipulation in an abstractprocess. We then sketch an algorithm that automaticallysynthesizes a workflow given its specification and a task library.
