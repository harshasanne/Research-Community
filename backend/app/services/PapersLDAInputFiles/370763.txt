Self-Reconfiguration of Service-Based Systems: A Case Study for Service Level Agreements and Resource Optimization.The configuration of a service-based system has a significant impacton the non-functional requirements of the system as a whole. However,finding the best configuration is very challenging and sometimes impossible for administrators because so many factors have to beconsidered. More importantly, a service based system has to befrequently reconfigured to adapt to rapid and continuous changes inuser requirements and runtime environments. In this paper we proposean autonomic computing approach to the problem of reconfiguration, that is, enabling the service based system to configure itself by meansof a loop of monitoring, analyzing, planning and executing actions.We begin by formalizing the definition of configuration and reconfiguration.Then, we describe how we implemented the autonomic computingmechanisms for reconfiguring service-based systems to satisfy ServiceLevel Agreements with minimal resource consumption. The approach isdemonstrated on a resilient service provisioning environment. Finally, the preliminary experiments are evaluated to determine the effectiveness ofproposed approach.
