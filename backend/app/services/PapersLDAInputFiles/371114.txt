A Hybrid Integrated Architecture for Language Service Composition.This paper reports on our experiences with combining Heart of Gold and Language Grid technology to provide more language resources available on Web. Heart of Gold is known as middleware architecture for integrating deep and shallow Natural Language Processing components. The Language Grid is an infrastructure built on top of the Internet to provide distributed language services. Having Heart of Gold available as Web services in the Language Grid environment would contribute to interoperability among language services.
