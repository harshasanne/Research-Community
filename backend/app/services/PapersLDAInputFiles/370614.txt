A Study of Service Composition with QoS Management.Quality of Services (QoS) management in compositions of servicesrequires careful consideration of QoS characteristics of the servicesand effective QoS management in their execution. A Web serviceis a software system that supports interoperable application-to- application interaction over the Internet. Web services are basedon a set of XML standards such as Simple Object Access Protocol(SOAP). The interactions of SOAP messages between Web servicesform the theoretical model of SOAP Message Exchange Patterns (MEP). Web Services Business Process Execution Language (WSBPEL)defines an interoperable integration model that facilitates automatedprocess integration in intra- and inter-corporate environments. A service-level agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a Webservices requestor and provider guaranteeing quantifiable issues atdefined levels only through mutual concessions. Based on a priorresearch work on Message Detail Record (MDR), this paper further proposes a SOAP message tracking model for supporting QoSend-to-end management in the context of WSBPEL and SLA. Thispaper motivates the study of QoS management in a Web servicecomposition framework with the evolution of a distributed toolkit in an industrial setting.
