An Architecture for Personal Semantic Web Information Retrieval System--Integrating Web Services and Web Contents.The semantic Web and Web services technologies have providedboth new possibilities and challenges to automatic informationprocessing. There are a lot of researches on applying these newtechnologies to current personal Web information retrieval systems,but no research addresses the semantic issues from the whole lifecycle and architecture point of view. Web services provide a new wayfor accessing Web resources, but until now, they have been managedseparately from conventional Web contents resources. In this paper, we point out new system requirements and propose aconceptual architecture for a personal semantic Web informationretrieval system. It incorporates semantic Web, Web services andmulti-agent technologies to enable not only precise location of Webresources but also the automatic or semi-automatic integration of hybridWeb contents and Web service resources.
