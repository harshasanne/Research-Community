Providing Privacy for Web Services by Anonymous Group Identification.In this paper we present a SOAP extension for protectingthe privacy of users of a Web Service. This extensionallows a user to prove to a remote SOAP server to be memberof a trusted group without revealing his/her identity.Our extension has been designed as to ensure interoperabilityamong SOAP applications written in different programminglanguages. We developed also some implementationsof our extension using different programming languages.Moreover, we conducted an extensive experimentationof our implementation to prove its feasibility in a real-worldcontext. In sums, our work suggest that privacy canbe added to Web Services with very little impact on the applicationdeveloper and without compromising the performanceof Web Services.
