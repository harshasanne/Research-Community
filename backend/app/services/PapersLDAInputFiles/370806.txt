Discovery of Web Services in a Federated Registry Environment.The potential of a large scale growth of private andsemi-private registries is creating the need for aninfrastructure which can support discovery andpublication over a group of autonomous registries.Recent versions of UDDI have made changes toaccommodate interactions between distributedregistries. In this paper, we discuss METEOR-S Webservice Discovery Infrastructure, which provides anontology-based infrastructure to access a group ofregistries that are divided based on business domainsand grouped into federations. We also discuss how Webservice discovery is carried out within a federation.
