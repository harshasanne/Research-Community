Orchestrating Composite Web Services under Data Flow Constraints.A composite service is typically specified using a language such asBPEL4WS and orchestrated by a single coordinator node in acentralized manner. The coordinator receives the client request,makes the required data transformations and invokes the componentweb services as per the specification. However, in certain scenariosbusinesses might want to impose restrictions on access to the datathey provide or the source from which they can accept data. Centralized orchestration can lead to violation of these data flow constraints as the central coordinator has access to the input and output dataof all the component web services. In many cases existing methodsof data encryption and authentication are not sufficient to handle suchconstraints. These data flow constraints, thus, present obstacles forcomposite web service orchestration. In this paper we propose a solution for orchestrating composite webservices under data flow constraints. The solution is based on decentralizedorchestration, in which a composite web service is broken into a setof partitions, one partition per component web service. To overcomedata flow constraints, each partition is executed within the same domain as the corresponding component web service and hence, hasthe same access rights. However, there are, in general, many ways todecentralize a composite web service. We apply a rule based filtering mechanism to choose a set of partitionsthat does not violate the specified data flow constraints.
