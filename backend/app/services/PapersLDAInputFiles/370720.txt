Resilient Trust Management for Web Service Integration.In a distributed web service integration environment, the selection of web services should be based on their reputation and quality-of- service (QoS). Various trust models for web services have beenproposed to evaluate the reputation of web services/service providers.Current mechanisms are based on tracing the feedbacks to the pastbehaviors of web services. However, very few of them consider therobustness and attackresiliency of the trust models. In this paper, wepresent an attack resilient distributed trust management system in aweb service management environment. The proposed attack resilient trust model uses two vectors to capture the behavior and the trustworthiness of a web service/service provider based on our analysison the possible attacks against the trust models. We also present aset of experiments that show the effectiveness of our trust model indetecting malicious behavior of service providers.
