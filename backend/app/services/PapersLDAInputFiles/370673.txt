JULIET: A Distributed Fault Tolerant Load Balancer for.NET Web Services.The execution time of computationally-intensive applications such as protein folding and fractal generation can be reduced by implementing theseapplications as web services that run in parallel.Additionally, some of these web services may save stateperiodically to resume execution later on. However,currently, there is no solution to load balance this classof web services, and to replicate the saved state for thepurposes of resumption. This paper describes thearchitecture of JULIET, a system that load balances.NET web services across a Windows cluster in adistributed fashion. The system is also fault tolerantsince it supports failovers and replication of datagenerated by the web services at the application level.The system is designed to be minimally-visible to theweb service and the client that consumes it.
