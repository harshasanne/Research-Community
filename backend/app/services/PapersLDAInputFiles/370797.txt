A Web Service Authentication Control System Based on SRP and SAML.Actually Internet applications can provide not only information, butalso, another way of getting distributed computing. Cooperativeinformation systems are autonomous and heterogeneous systems, distributed geographically, but interconnected. Web Services providesa set of interoperable standards that can be used to connect distributedapplications. On this environment, security is a critical issue, and an attack can expose systems services without authentication. Anend-to-end connection, like the ones involved in such systems,usually requires that an authentication can be shared between differentinformation systems. Web Services security model is not yet fully definedand a lot of proposals are emerging, delaying the adoption of thistechnology in many situations. In this paper we present multiplatformauthentication control system based on an extension of SRP protocol,using SAML. Within this solution, authentication control can be leveraged,even with weak passwords and an authentication assertion can be exchanged with different cooperative information systems.
