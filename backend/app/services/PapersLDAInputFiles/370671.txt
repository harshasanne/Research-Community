A Semantic Template Based Designer for Web Processes.The growing popularity of Service Oriented Computing based onWeb services standards is creating a need for paradigms to representand design business processes. Significant work has been done inthe representation aspects with regards to WSBPEL. However,design and modeling of business processes is still an open issue. In this paper, we present a novel designer for business processes, whichallows for intuitive modeling of Web processes, as well as using atemplate based approach for semi-automatically integrating partnerseither at design time or at deployment time. This work has been done aspart of the METEOR-S project, which concentrates on adding semanticsto the entire Web process lifecycle.
