Code Generation for WSLAs using AXpect.WSLAs can be viewed as describing the serviceaspect of web services. By their nature, web services aredistributed. Therefore, integrating support code into a webservice application is potentially costly and error prone. Viewedfrom this AOP perspective, then, we present a method forintegrating WSLAs into code generation using the AXpectweaver, the AOP technology for Infopipes. This helps to localizethe code physically and therefore increase the eventualmaintainability and enhance the reuse of the WSLA code. Wethen illustrate the weavers capability by using a WSLAdocument to codify constraints and metrics for a streamingimage application that requires CPU resource monitoring.
