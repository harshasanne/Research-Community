Recent Advances in CFD Grid Application Platform.The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) Grid Application Platform provides a Grid environment for CFD applications using high performance computing. It adopts Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), bases IBM's Service Domain, extends and customizes it for CFD applications in several modules, such as service requesting, job scheduling, job management, failure recovering and etc. By defining general CFD application interfaces such as data format, the platform integrates different CFD applications, including mesh generation, domain decomposing and resolvers, to follow the workflow customized by end-users to finish a complete CFD job. Furthermore, CFD applications development specifications and packages are provided to facilitates migrating most of sequence and parallel CFD applications to the platform. Currently, a prototype system is available online to public for testing.
