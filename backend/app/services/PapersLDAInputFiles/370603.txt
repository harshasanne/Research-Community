Tool Support for Model-Based Engineering of Web Service Compositions.In this paper we describe tool support for a model-based approach toverifying compositions of web service implementations. The tool supportsverification of properties created from design specifications and implementation models to confirm expected results from the viewpointsof both the designer and implementer. Scenarios are modeled in UML,in the form of Message Sequence Charts (MSCs), and then compiledinto the Finite State Process (FSP) algebra to concisely model the required behavior. BPEL4WS implementations are mechanicallytranslated to FSP to allow an equivalence trace verification process tobe performed. By providing early design verification and validation, the implementation, testing and deployment of web service compositionscan be eased through the understanding of the behavior exhibited bythe composition. The tool is implemented as a plug-in for the Eclipsedevelopment environment providing cooperating tools for specification, formal modeling and trace animation of the composition process.
