Constructing a Context-Aware Service-Oriented Reputation Model Using Attention Allocation Points.In this paper we examine the problem of rich information environments and the need to narrow the agents attention to what is important for them to interact and later to evaluate and transfer reputation values, using Attention Allocation technique (AA). We also argue that this cannot be done without the aid of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). Reputation is used in our work as a service, presenting a new concept- that is Reputation-as-a-Service (RaaS). We then present a service-oriented model for optimizing the presentation and the use of reputation in order to maximize its value to both users and providers.
