A Polyarchical Middleware for Self-Regenerative Invocation of Multi-Standard Ubiquitous Services.Whilst the vision of a robust Service-OrientedArchitecture (SOA) is very seductive it engenders manytechnical challenges. The main challenge is thedevelopment and support of runtime cross-standardservice activation and interoperation. Suchinteroperation will provide a vital stepping-stonetowards the integration of the emerging SOA standardsand legacy services - those developed using existingmiddleware architectures such as DCOM, COBRA,J2EE, Web service, JXTA, and Jini. Much relatedworks already exist including WSIF framework, whichprovides APIs to support design-time invocation ofcross-standard Web services deployed on multipleSOAP packages. However, this paper focuses on aruntime self-regenerative mechanism related toadaptive service invocation code. The paper willpresent a runtime service adaptation mechanism,which supports end-users to dynamically adapt tovariations in the execution environment, withoutaltering their original design, crossing multiplestandards (both synchronous and asynchronousinvocation models) and middleware architectures. Thispaper also introduces a proposed "PolyarchicalMiddleware" architecture to support such self-regenerativeservice adaptation. An illustrative example will be used to describe the approach and thecurrent implementation. The paper will conclude withgeneral remarks and mention of further work.
