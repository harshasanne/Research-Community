JClarens: A Java Framework for Developing and Deploying Web Services for Grid Computing.High Energy Physics (HEP) and other scientific communities haveadopted Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) [1][2] as part of alarger Grid computing effort. This effort involves the integration of many legacy applications and programming libraries into a SOAframework. The Grid Analysis Environment (GAE) [3] is such a service oriented architecture based on the Clarens Grid Services Framework[4][5] and is being developed as part of the Compact Muon Solenoid(CMS) [6] experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [7] atEuropean Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN) [8]. Clarens providesa set of authorization, access control, and discovery services, aswell as XMLRPC and SOAP access to all deployed services. Twoimplementations of the Clarens Web Services Framework (Python and Java) offer integration possibilities for a wide range of programminglanguages. This paper describes the Java implementation of the ClarensWeb Services Framework called �_JClarens.�_ and several web services of interest to the scientific and Grid community that havebeen deployed using JClarens.
