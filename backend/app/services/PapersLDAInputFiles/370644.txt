A Survey of J2EE Application Performance Management Systems.J2EE components and APIs have remained largelyunmined, and their potential as performance barometers therefore largely unrealized, because the tools businesses have traditionally wielded to servicetransactions-database servers, directory services,application servers themselves-have been unable toprovide businesses and software developers the accessthey need to capture, measure, and optimize discretetransactions. Businesses that lack insight into J2EEcomponents and APIs lack the ability to manage someof e-business's most vital performance assets, assetsthat, when performing poorly or not at all, can downwhole distributed applications. This paper discusses therequirements of J2EE application performancemanagement systems and five commercial tools.
