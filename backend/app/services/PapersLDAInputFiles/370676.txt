Schema Based Enhancement of XPath Engine.While a streaming-XPath engine provides a more efficient XPathevaluation performance than a DOM based engine, it still requirestime to parse a whole XML document at least once. Taking intoconsideration that XPath is used to extract data from Web Servicemessages, the target element may be in the first part of documents, such as the SOAP Headers. Therefore, it is wasteful to parse adocument all the way to the end. We present a new XPath enginenamed "XScope," which eliminates parsing XML documents bySchema information. In this paper, we describe the XScope approach,then evaluate its performance and show that the engine works effectivelyin Web Services.
