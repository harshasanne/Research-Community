JClarens: A Java Based Interactive Physics Analysis Environment for Data Intensive Applications.In this paper we describe JClarens; a Java based implementation of the Clarens remote dataserver. JClarens provides web services for an interactive analysis environment to dynamicallyaccess and analyze the tremendous amount of data scattered across various locations.Additionally this research is aimed to develop a service oriented Grid Enabled Portal (GEP) that provides interface and access to several Grid services to give a homogeneous and optimized view of the distributed and heterogeneousenvironment. Other than showing platform independent behavior provided by Java, the useof XML-RPC based Web Services enabled JClarens to be a language neutral server anddemonstrated interoperability with its Python variant. Extreme care has been taken in theusage and manipulation of various Java libraries to cater the needs of high performancecomputing. The overall exercise has yielded in a prototype with strong emphasis on security and virtual organization management (VOM). This shall provide a common platform to supportdevelopment of larger, more flexible framework with future aims to integrate it with a looselycoupled, decentralized, and autonomous framework for Grid enabled AnalysisEnvironment (GAE).
