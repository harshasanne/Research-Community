Services Ecosystem: Towards a Resilient Infrastructure for On Demand Services Provisioning in Grid.The dynamic nature of the Grid environment bringschallenges to the services provisioning technique. A majoraspect of Grid is to match demands for services withresources. Since resources and demands are fluctuating,Grid services provisioning need to be adjustedaccordingly in responding to changes. In this paper, wepropose a novel approach, Grid services migration, toenabling services provisioning on demand. The majormotivation is to achieve the desired Quality of Service(QoS) such as performance, reliability, and etc. of Gridservices on resources assembled dynamically respondingto dynamic demand. In this paper, the technicalcharacteristics of Grid services migration and itstaxonomy are introduced. The Grid service migrationalgorithms are also presented. The Grid servicesmigration framework with MAPE (Monitor, Analyze,Plan, and Execute) loop is proposed based on Open GridServices Architecture (OGSA) and the prototype namedServices Ecosystem, a resilient infrastructure for servicesprovisioning on demand in Grid is developed.Demonstrations and experiments are conducted andresults are presented to illustrate the capabilities of Gridservices migration.
