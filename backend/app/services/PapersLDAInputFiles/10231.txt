Approaches to Establishing Multicast Overlays.In the past a few years, provision of an Internet-scale multicast with the use of application-level routing components has generated a lots of interests both within the research community and in the commercial world [1], [2], [3], [4]. Overlay Multicast is a concept representing such multicast scheme. Overlay multicast offers accelerated deployment, simplified configuration, and better access control. In this paper we present an overview of the existing overlay multicast solutions and classify them according to different criteria. Also we compared the performance between topologyindependent and topology-aware end-system multicast and performance difference of topology-aware end-system multicast and proxy-based multicast.
