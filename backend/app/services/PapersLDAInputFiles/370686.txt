Polimatica: Abstraction for Customizable Private Virtual Organizations in Global Grids.We have developed an application service hostingmiddleware for enterprise information systems, "Polimatica",upon which a policy-customizable private virtual organization(pVO) is built. The pVO is a collection of customizableapplication services in the global grid computing environment."Polimatica" is distinctive in terms of abstraction capabilitiesin (1) policy instance description, (2) view synthesis of anextensive resource data model, (3) operation aggregation onthe OGSI extension interfaces. The performance to enforcethe policy instances is measured in a laboratory testbed for anenterprise ASP, providing B2B e-commerce (BizEngine/WS)and interactive media communication service (LiveComm).We have verified that, in 60 seconds, the feedback loop in apVO adjusts the application services as customized given thechanging environment.
