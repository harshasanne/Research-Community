National Population Information System Based on Web Services.To address the issue of isolated information island in national population information system, we present a kind of multi-layers hierarchical service-oriented architecture. In the architecture, the top nodes are only the requestors of web services, and all the leaf nodes of the bottom layer are only the providers of web services. For those nodes of intermediate layers, every node is not only the provider of web services, but also the dispatcher of web services. All isolated information islands are connected by web services dispatcher and web services registry database to form a uniform collaborative system. The command (web service invocation) is recursively multicasted from top layer to bottom layer and statistical result data are gathered from bottom layer to top layer. We implement service integration, information integration and information sharing of national population information system.
