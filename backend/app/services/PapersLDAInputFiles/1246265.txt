Aspect-Oriented Quality of Service for Web Services: A Model-Driven Approach.Implementing and maintaining non-functional properties related to the monitoring of Quality of Service (QoS) can be expensive and complex tasks; with this paper, we present a model-based approach to the implementation of QoS monitors. Our approach uses platform-independent models in order to describe the system and its related QoS constraints. Then, we conduct Model-Driven Development (MDD) transformations for the implementation of both the system and its QoS constraints. Following the Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) paradigm, QoS constraints are implemented as aspects, which are weaved into the system implementation. Finally, we present a case study in order to support the evaluation of our approach.
