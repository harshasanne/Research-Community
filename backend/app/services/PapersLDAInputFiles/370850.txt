A Unified Approach for the Discovery of Web and Peer-to-Peer Services.As the web service technology matures, other computing paradigms such as peer-to-peer gradually adopt the service-oriented approach and are beginning to expose functionality as services. Hence there will soon be a need for integration of these heterogeneous services, for the development of service-oriented applications. The first step to accomplish this is to establish a unified approach for service discovery. In this paper, we briefly present a query language along with its enacting service search engine which is used for effectively discovering web and p2p services in a unified manner.
