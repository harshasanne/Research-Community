Towards Intelligent Services: A Case Study in Chemical Emergency Response.In a short period the Web has become an important part of our lives.However, the full potential of the web is still not realized. Two recentdevelopments--web services and the semantic web--are steps in thedirection of utilizing the full potential of the Web. Web services allow applications to utilize the web for automatically extracting(and updating) information while the semantic web enterprise promisesto provide the infrastructure that allows intelligent web services to berapidly created and deployed. However, with this comes the taskof transforming the traditional web-based systems to web-servicesover the semantic web. In this paper, we demonstrate how an existingsuccessful web-based system for providing help to first responders ofchemically hazardous emergencies (called E-plan) can be converted into a web-services based model using the semantic web and intelligentreasoning technologies. Our efforts can be regarded as a case study inconverting monolithic web-based applications to a more agile, rapidlydeployable intelligent web-services model.
