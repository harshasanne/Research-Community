InfoParser: Infoset Driven XML Processing for Web Services.This paper presents InfoParser, an Infoset driven XML processing mechanism aimed to amend current SOAP engines by substituting Infoset, XML binding for Object, XML (O/X) mapping, which is responsible for several acute issues in web services, including O/X impedance mismatch, portability, XML alienation, complexity and memory overhead. The proposed InfoParser approach not only avoids issues in object based framework, but also significantly reduces the complexity in XML centric approach. InfoParser can be described formally by just a few set-theoretic equations, yet it offers a promising alternative to current options in moving web services towards more semantics driven, light weight and loosely coupled programming paradigm that can work on any devices. We have implemented a prototype InfoParser in Java and the preliminary experiments indicate that the approach is feasible.
