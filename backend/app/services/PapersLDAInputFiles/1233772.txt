Ontology Alignment Based Service Interface Adaptation.The emerging web service technologies have received increasing attention in both industry and academic communities. The interoperability it promised has made it more welcome than other integration technologies. However, web services may not be able to interact with one another directly due to interface mismatches. It happens when the service consumer and service provider have different message signatures. In this paper, we proposed an automatic interface adaptation approach that exploits ontology alignment tool. We propose a method that enables the interaction between WSDL described web service and semantic web services .We have also developed a method that extracts relevant semantic information from original annotation ontology to construct a compact ontology, in order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of ontology alignment results.
