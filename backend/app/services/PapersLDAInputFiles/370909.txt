A Semantic Web Services Enabled Web Portal Architecture.Web services technologies are emerging as a new approachfor supporting e-Science and e-Engineering by providingaccess to heterogeneous computation resources andintegration of distributed scientific applications. In this paper,we propose a web portal architecture that enables endusers to access the distributed application through the webinterface and to compose new tasks by integrating a set ofhigh level web services provided by portal developers. Theportal design demonstrates that flexibility, reusability andinteroperability can be provided for both end users and portaldevelopers by using semantic web services technologies.
