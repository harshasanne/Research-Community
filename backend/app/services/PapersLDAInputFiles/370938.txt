WSCE: A Flexible Web Service Composition Environment.In this paper, we propose the concepts of virtualpartner and inspector into the web servicescomposition. Virtual partner, as an IT level concept, isa web service (pseudo web service) using the sameinterface with the actual partner but different bindingmessage. A virtual partner can be invoked directly by abusiness process described by BPEL, so that the BPELprogrammer can test both application's functionalityand non functionality performance early in thedevelopment cycle to avoid any problems in the finalruntime, or test the selection of their partners inbusiness level design. The IT virtual partners providedevelopers with a range of the techniques which letthem explore every aspect of their program. Inspectoris proposed when using the third -party process engine.An inspector itself is also a web service. Theprogrammer can register any required outputinformation in it. The IT virtual partner and theinspector concepts have been integrated in our WSCE,a flexible Web Services Composition Environment for abusiness process. WSCE is a prototype of autonomicmodeling and simulation environment. With the help ofa third-party BPEL engine, it provides programmerwith concepts and tools to facilitate business process programming.
