Scalable Peer-to-Peer Process Management - The OSIRIS Approach.The functionality of applications is increasingly beingmade available by services. General concepts and standardslike SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI support the discoveryand invocation of single web services. State-of-the-art process management is conceptually based on a centralizedprocess manager. The resources of this coordinatorlimit the number of concurrent process executions, especiallysince the coordinator has to persistently store eachstate change for recovery purposes. In this paper, we overcomethis limitation by executing processes in a peer-to-peerway exploiting all nodes of the system. By distributingthe execution and navigation costs, we can achieve a higherdegree of scalability allowing for a much larger throughputof processes compared to centralized solutions. This papersdescribes our prototype system OSIRIS, which implementssuch a true peer-to-peer process execution. We furtherpresent very promising results verifying the advantagesover centralized process management in terms of scalability.
