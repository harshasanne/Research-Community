Web Services Mobility in a Pocket.The infiltration of the Web as the preferred choice for onlinee-commerce and IT applications has motivated the need tointroduce innovative mechanisms to enforce strong securitymonitoring and control on transactions conducted over a distributedenvironment. The smart card technology presents an attractivesolution for providing strong security and access control mechanismsthat are tightly bound and associated to the individual carrying andowning the card. Despite its potential, smart card services have notbeen integrated into the networked environment in the way otherportable computing devices, such as notebooks, PDA, mobile phones,and so on, have been. This has motivated our design for a distributedcomputing platform for smart card services to operate over a service- oriented architecture (SOA) based on evolving Web Servicestechnology. In particular, the paper presents the design of theWSCard (in short for Web Services Card) architecture and itsimplementation based on the application of web services wrappingtechnology. Importantly, the design allows us to exploit Web Services flexibility to provide a heterogeneous and promote rapidintegration of smart card services as first class citizens of web services.With WSCard, existing service-oriented applications can seamlessly interoperate with smart card services by treating the card services asnative web services, while employing established web services standards-- SOAP, WSDL and UDDI.
