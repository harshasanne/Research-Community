Decentralized Decision-Making Protocol for Service Composition.Service composition based on state dependent services is a challengeif it done in a decentralized way, that is without a centralized coordinating partner knowing all involved parties.In particular, the challenge is thecombination of services to a composite service, such that every partyinvolved considers its view of the composite service to be acceptable. In the paper a protocol is proposed which incrementally derives proposals for composite services.These proposals are then evaluated by theinvolved parties locally and a consensus on the local decision on acceptingor rejecting the proposed composite service is derived.
