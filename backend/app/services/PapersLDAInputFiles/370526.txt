Manners Externalize Semantics for On-demand Composition of Context-aware Services.Architectural mismatch [Architectural Mismatch, or, Why it's hard to build systems out of existing parts]; the semantic and syntactic gappreventing component composition, can be partially alleviatedthrough the ubiquity of the protocols for service composition(syntax). And yet, the semantics of service or componentcomposition have remained elusive. The contribution of this paperbuilds on the notions introduced by grammar-oriented objectdesign (GOOD) using the notion of manners to specify thesemantics of services and drive their automated compositionthrough dynamically re-configure architectures enabled throughGOOD. This leads to the use of manners for explicit servicesemantics representation in a re-configurable architectural style.We describe the base requirements for automated component andservices composition and show how automated assembly ofcomponents and services can be accomplished through adynamically reconfigurable (DyRec) architectural style.In addition, we show how this vision of dynamic reconfigurationis naturally supported by the Web services framework, because itderives from some of the core requirements of the ServiceOriented Architectures (SOA) style embodied by Web services.Further, we discuss how such a DyRec architectural style can beimplemented using grammar-oriented object design (GOOD) anddescribe a project that led to a tool called the Business Compiler,to accomplish dynamic composition and collaboration.
