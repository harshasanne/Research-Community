Toward UML Profiles for Web Services and their Extra-Functional Properties.Web Service technologies offer a successful way for interoperability among applications. Now it is important to face how to model systems based on service functionality and also how to add extra-functional properties to them. This is the reason why we propose first of all a versatile and simple UML profile based on the Service Component Architecture specification for modeling services and, secondly, a new UML profile is proposed in order to model and reuse extra-functional properties in the named models. Besides, the property profile provides enough information to enable property code and description generation at a later stage.
