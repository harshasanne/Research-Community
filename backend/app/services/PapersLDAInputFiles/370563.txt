Towards a Web Service Composition Management Framework.We suggest that the composition of Web services is an activity that needs to be managed, and that Web Service CompositionManagement is distinct from the management of individual Webservices. We describe a set of requirements to help make thisdistinction.

Then, we discuss architecturalalternatives (centralized, federated, and peer-to-peer) for a Web service composition management framework.
