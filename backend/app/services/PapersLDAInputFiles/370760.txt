Using Workflows to Coordinate Web Services in Pervasive Computing Environments.Pervasive Computing Environments augmentphysical spaces with a large number of devices andservices that help users perform different kinds of tasks.Users in these environments interact with one or moreweb services using various devices to achieve theirgoals. One of the problems in these environments isdiscovering and coordinating different web services forachieving the user's goals. Users may not be aware ofwhich services and devices are available in anunfamiliar environment and how to interact with themin order to achieve their goals. In order to simplify auser's interaction with the environment, we present anovel approach of modeling and managing a user'sinteraction with the environment based on workflows.We have built a prototype, using the popular businessworkflow language(BPEL) that models variousprocesses in pervasive environments as workflows. Wefound that this approach improves the usability of theseenvironments. It also increases flexibility in changingthe model of interaction without having to touchindividual services and applications. This approach isparticularly useful in helping visitors in public spaceslike malls, museums, supermarkets and hospitals.
