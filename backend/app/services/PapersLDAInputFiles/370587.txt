Building Desktop Applications with Web Services in a Message-based MVC Paradigm.Over the past decade, classic client side applications with Model-View-Controller (MVC)architecture haven't changed much but become more complex. In this paper, we present anapproach of building desktop applications with Web Services in an explicit message-based MVC aradigm. By integrating with our publish/subscribe messaging middleware, itmakes SVG browser (a Microsoft PowrrPoint like client application) with Web Service styleinterfaces universally accessible from different client platforms - Windows, Linux, MacOS,PalmOS and other customized ones. Performance data suggests that this scheme ofbuilding application around messages is a practical architecture for the next generationWeb application client.
