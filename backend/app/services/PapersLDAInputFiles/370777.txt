Adaptive Grid Service Flow Management: Framework and Model.Grid computing provides the basic software infrastructure forintegrating geographically distributed resources and services throughstandardized Grid services. One of the key challenges to enable thebroader use of Grid services beyond the domain of scientificcomputing is the ability to perform complex tasks that require themodeling and coordination of the enactment of a number ofdistributed Grid services. Workflow technology is a good candidatefor supporting Grid service flow. However, traditional workflow isstatic, thus unable to exploit the dynamic information available in theGrid and respond to the dynamic nature of the Grid. In this paper, wepresent an adaptive framework that provides adaptive management ofGrid service flows. The framework is based on an Adaptive GridService Flow Model and is supported by an Event-Trigger-Rule(ETR) technology that will be used to trigger rules in a distributedfashion to adapt a Grid service flow to the dynamic Grid environmentand the changing requirements of a Grid application.
