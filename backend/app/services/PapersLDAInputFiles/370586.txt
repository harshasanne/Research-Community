Web Service Enablement of Communication Services.In this paper, we introduce Web Service Application SessionServices, WS-Session, for Web service based application sessionmanagement in communication. A two-way Web service frameworkis described. It supports the use of Web service in the situation of telecommunication where the communication endpoint can be botha client and a peer-to-peer server. We describe the interface designin two-way Web service interaction based on the concept of tightlycoupled interface and loosely coupled interface solutions. The proposed approach provides full support of asynchronous outboundoperations and event notifications in communication services. It isimplemented in a research prototype system that provides bothstandard based (ECMA-348) services and Avaya service extensions.In addition, we investigated the integration of our proposed approachwith BPEL4WS. It allows the user to create new services through adrag-n-drop based service creation environment (ECLIPSE/BPEL4WS).It leads to a paradigm of service creation through Web service composition.More sophisticated telecommunication services are created fromcomposing the basic services.
