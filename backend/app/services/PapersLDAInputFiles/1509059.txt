2007 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2007) 9-13 July 2007 Salt Lake City Utah USAA new biosensor structure, characterized by two layers of metal nano-particle, is proposed and fabricated with NSL (Nano-sphere Lithography) process. It improves sensitivity by exciting LSPR (Localized Surface Plasmonic Resonance) interactions between electromagnetic fields in the two layers. A simple microfluidic integration scheme for the sensor is designed for real-time and in-situ detection. As an important part of the scheme, a new microfluidic pumping mechanism is analyzed and verified with a prototype.
