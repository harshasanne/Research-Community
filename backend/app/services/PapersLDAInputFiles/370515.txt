Targeting Heterogeneous Multimedia Environments with Web Services.The number of networked multimedia platforms that areintroduced into the market has increased dramatically in recentyears. Current approaches to multimedia distributiondo not scale to this growing set of client configurations andheterogeneous dynamic networks. We propose a distributedarchitecture that offers a scalable solution to multimediapublication and distribution in such heterogeneous environments.It builds upon recent standardization efforts relatedto web services. This paper details the multimedia web servicesat the proxy server, that cooperate on a loosely coupledbasis to tailor content creators' multimedia presentationsto clients' environments. The experiments show thatour web service-oriented architecture offers a significantadded value in heterogeneous multimedia environments.
