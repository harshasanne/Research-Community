Matchmaking for Semantic Web Services.The most important topic about the web recently is semantic web services. The current trend of the software development is to reduce the development time, but at the same time increase the functionality, reusability and stability of the building block without worrying about how the service is implemented. As the number of services available on the web increases, the difficulty for both the service requester and provider to look for the most suitable potential counterpart will also increase. Matchmaking therefore is an important aspect of the web interactions, which enable both service requester and provider trim down the amount of time to meet the most suitable potential counterpart. In this paper we describe how to blend the matchmaking algorithm to the typical web service architecture.
