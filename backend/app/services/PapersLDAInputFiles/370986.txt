Easy SOA: Rapid Prototyping environment withWeb Services for End Users.This paper describes Easy SOA. Easy SOA is a rapid prototyping model for SOA based on Ad hoc Development and Integration tool for End Users (ADIEU). With ADIEU, end users can prototype their Web applications and Web Services rapidly by putting 'cards' into a 'sheet' constructed on a Web browser. Easy SOA realizes a prototype development model for Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as well as for Web applications and Web Services using ADIEU.
