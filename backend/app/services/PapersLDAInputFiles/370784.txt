Location-Mediated Coordination of Web Services in Ubiquitous Computing.A fundamental issue of human-centered coordinatingservices in Ubiquitous Computing is concerned with dynamicservice coordination according to users' intensions.How can we coordinate the services to assist the user in receivinga coordinated service to maximize the user's satisfactionin an environment? In order to solve this issue, wehave been developing a sort of agent-based coordinationframework, called "location-mediated agent coordination,"that orchestrates Web Services embedded in the real worldand Web Services on the Internet. In this paper, we show aprototype application of the framework, context-aware informationassist services in a museum.
