Improving Web Service QoS for Wireless Pervasive Devices.The web services enable interaction among remote and diverseapplications running on disparate platforms. While the service providersoffer generic service response to meet the requirements of diverse client applications, it is the responsibility of the application to extractrelevant data from the response. This causes performance overheadsfor power and network bandwidth limited pervasive devices due tonetworking and parsing excess data. It is thus important for servicesand pervasive applications to interact in a way that optimally utilizesthe resources of the pervasive device. In this paper we describe anefficient interaction methodology between web services and pervasive applications that optimizes the service quality for the device. We extendthe quality of service definition beyond service response time to includepower and airtime utilization and allow pervasive applications to be awareabout it to dynamically adapt to the services and the available resourcesof the device in realtime.
