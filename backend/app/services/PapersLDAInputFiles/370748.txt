A Methodology for Engineering Collaborative Applications over Mobile Web Objects using SyD Middleware.Future web applications will be more collaborative and will use thestandard and ubiquitous Internet protocols. We have previouslydeveloped System on Mobile Devices (SyD) middleware to rapidlydevelop and deploy collaborative applications over heterogeneousand possibly mobile devices hosting web objects. In this paper, wepresent the software engineering methodology for developing SyD- enabled web applications and illustrate it through a case study on a System of Calendar application, with implementation on iPAQsand its performance metrics study. SyD-enabled web objects allowus to create a collaborative application rapidly with limited coding. In this case study, the modular software architecture allowed us tohide the inherent heterogeneity among devices, data stores, andnetworks by presenting a uniform and persistent object view of mobilecalendar objects interacting through XML/SOAP requests and responses. The performance results we obtained show that theapplication scales well as we increase the group size and adapts wellwithin the constraints of mobile devices.
