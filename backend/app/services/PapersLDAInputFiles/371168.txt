Publishing Dynamic State Changes of Resources through State Aware WSDL.A common architecture in today's development of distributed systems is the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) implemented using web services. Until recently, it was difficult to build a SOA based grid/distributed system using web services due to the inability to learn the state of services. The state of a web service could only be accessed through specialized clients and/or services. Should the specialized client or service fail, the state can't be accessed. This paper shows the innovative Resources Via Web Instances (RVWI) framework. RVWI grants to web services the ability to show the state of dynamic resources in their WSDL. This was achieved via software components called Connectors which watch for any changes in a resource and updates the web service. The significance of this report is the support for resources which can change state between requests and the innovation is the improvement of state updates between the service and discovery services.
