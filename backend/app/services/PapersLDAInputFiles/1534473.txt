Computing Service Skylines over Sets of Services.We propose a skyline computation approach that enables service users to optimally access sets of services as an integrated service package. We first present a one pass algorithm based on the observation that a multi-service skyline is completely determined by single service skylines. The skyline is returned after an enumeration on a significantly reduced candidate space. We then develop a dual progressive algorithm that is able to progressively report the skyline. We conduct an experimental study to assess the performance of the skyline computation approaches. The ACM Portal is published by the Association for Computing Machinery. Copyright ï¿½ 2010 ACM, Inc.
