Solution Architecture for N-Tier Applications.This paper defines a service-oriented Solution Architecture for N-Tier Applications (SANTA), primarily for web-based distributed systems. Most conventional Internet applications have been built on three tiers - web, application, and database tiers as described in the predominant 3-tier architectural style on both Java EE and .Net platforms. However, a number of leading-edge technologies have matured, which need to be incorporated into the logical solution architecture, such as portal, process choreography, business rule engine, enterprise service bus, web services, service composition, etc. A new serviceoriented model is proposed in this paper, to extend the traditional 3-tier architectural style and position the emerging technologies/products in the right places in the architecture structure. This new architecture model comprises a stack of six interrelated layers, coupled with six vertical pillars. The six layers are Access & Integration, Business Process, Composite Services, Services & Components, Integration & Communications, and Enterprise Resources layer. The Runtime Infrastructure pillars are composed of the Operational Management, Security, and Hosting Environment pillar, whereas the Development Process pillars consist of the Application & Service Frameworks, Crosscutting Aspects & Patterns, and Modeling & Development Tools pillar. This holistic application architecture framework is a systematic taxonomy of major technical constituents of a distributed application in a service-oriented paradigm. Part of this comprehensive model has been extensively utilized in one form or another to design various SOA solutions in different industry sectors.
