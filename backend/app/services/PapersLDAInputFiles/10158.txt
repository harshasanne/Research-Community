A SRP Based Handler for Web Service Access Control.Security is a critical issue. The wide use of Internet applications has tremendous benefits, but a security fail can expose confidential data. Web Services is a software application that can be remotely accessed over Internet using interoperable standards based on XML. At this time, there are no broadly adopted specifications for Web Services security and in this paper we present an extension to the SRP (Secure Remote Password) protocol in order to apply access control to a Web Service as an independent layer. This additional independent layer can be built on any available Web Service platform. In this work we have used Apache AXIS for this end.
