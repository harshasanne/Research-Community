Adapting the Communication of Web Services to the Language of Their User Community.This paper presents the WS-Talk interface layer, aconcept for a structured natural language interfacewhich virtualizes the composition of Web services atthe end-user's side. As the number of available Webservices grows, the representation of the context inwhich they are used becomes more and more an issuefor both service providers and service consumers.While providers concentrate more on the technicallevels of activation and communication within aservice network, the users, i.e. the service consumers,want to form ad-hoc collaborations between Webservices. To shield users of Web services from thetechnical details of finding and combining them, asemantic level has to be found that suits their specificneeds and expertise. Through a semantic layer, WS-Talktries to create a level of abstraction that enablesviews on services expressed in natural language. Toreduce the complexity of natural language, domain-specificlanguages are defined and their semantics aremapped onto Web services and their attributes. Thedomain of economics is currently used for testingarchitecture and usage aspects of the WS-Talkinterface layer.
