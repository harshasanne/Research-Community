Managing Asynchronous Web Services Interactions.Asynchronous interactions are becoming more andmore important in the implementation of complex B2BWeb applications. This paper addresses correlationand coordination issues involved with asynchronousWeb services, by studying different mechanisms andmetadata structures for supporting them; in addition,several interaction patterns for building asynchronouscomputations are discussed, and the trade-offs betweenthe various patterns are shown. In conclusion, weillustrate the use of asynchronous Web services in thecontext of some concrete B2B applications.
