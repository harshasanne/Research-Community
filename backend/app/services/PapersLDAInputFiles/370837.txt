Introducing Dynamic Distributed Coordination in Web Services for Next Generation Service Platforms.We present a technique called Dynamic DistributedService Coordination Protocol (DDSCP) that enablesdynamic and distributed coordination for composedservices and applications in telecommunicationnetworks. Individual service components are modeledas web services and DDSCP facilitates coordinationamong these components by dispatching executableprocesses to the service components that specifydifferent steps that the service component must followin response to (receipt of) specific messages andevents. The collective and concurrent execution ofthese processes at different service componentsachieves overall goals of the service. The planningand creation of these processes is not our focus in thispaper. We describe the structure and processing ofdifferent messages DDSCP, and describe how thisprotocol can work.Our model has several advantages over the existingservice platforms for 3rd Generation Mobile Networks,such as Parlay/OSA, and the web-service compositionmodels. These advantages include introduction offlexibility among network components at finest level,ease of creation of highly customized services, easyintegration with foreign components, reducedapplication complexity, increased reuse of applicationcomponents, and possibility of increased userparticipation in managing her services, and thusreducing load on the network.
