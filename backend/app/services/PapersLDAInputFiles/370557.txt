A Broker-Based Approach for Improving Web Services Reliability.As Web services start to be deployed for mission critical applicationsand for e-Business scenarios, higher Quality of Service (QoS) andcontinuous service delivery become a critical issue to ensure high availability and reliability in spite of the failure or unavailability of theparticipating services or networks. These challenges call for vastimprovements in the Web services containers and the mediation infrastructure. To address these requirements, we propose WebServices Message Bus (wsBus), a lightweight service-orientedmiddleware for reliable and fault tolerant Web services interactions.This paper first discusses wsBus architecture and features and then it reports some experimental results to illustrate theeffectiveness of wsBus in adding reliable and uninterrupted servicesto a supply chain management system.
