A Peer-to-Peer Framework for Web Service Discovery with Ranking.Current Web service discovery methods are based oncentralized approaches where Web services are identifiedbased on service functionality. Examples of service functionalityinclude car rental, hotel booking and book selling.Since higher level Web services are increasingly composedin terms of lower level Web services, it is importantthat service discovery not only be based on service functionalitybut also be based on process behavior, i.e., how aservice functionality is served. Furthermore, centralized approachesto service discovery suffer from problems such ashigh operational and maintenance cost, single point of failure,and scalability. Another issue that has not been consideredin current Web service discovery paradigms is the issueof trust and quality of service of the service provider.We, therefore, propose a structured peer-to-peer frameworkfor Web service discovery in which Web services are locatedbased on both service functionality and process behavior. Inaddition, we integrate a scalable reputation model in thisdistributed peer-to-peer framework to rank Web servicesbased on both trust and service quality.
