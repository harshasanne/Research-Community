Automated Synthesis of Composite BPEL4WS Web Services.In this paper we propose a technique for the automated synthesisof new composite web services. Given a set of abstract BPEL4WSdescriptions of component services, and a composition requirement,we automatically generate an executable BPEL4WS process that,once deployed, is able to interact with the components to satisfy therequirement. We implement the proposed approach exploiting efficientsynthesis techniques, and experiment with some case studies takenfrom real world applications and with a parameterized domain. We showthat the technique can scale up to cases in which the manual developmentof BPEL4WS composite services is not trivial and is time consuming.
