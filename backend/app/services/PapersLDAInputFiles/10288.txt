A SOA based Self-Adaptive PERSONAL MOBILITY MANAGER.Service oriented applications integrate heterogenous web services, which are deployed and maintained by different providers, and can evolve dynamically and autonomously. Autonomous changes of web services manifest only at run time, and may lead to unexpected failures. This paper proposes an approach to designing selfadaptive applications, which can react to changes in the implementation of services, thus avoiding unexpected failures. The architecture proposed in this paper automatically detects possible integration mismatches, and dynamically executes suitable adaptation strategies. The paper presents an application, the Personal Mobility Manager, which integrates heterogeneous web services, identifies failures that derive from dynamic changes in the integrated services, and illustrates the self-adaptive design solution which can prevent run time failures.
