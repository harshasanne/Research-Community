Triana: A Graphical Web Service Composition and Execution Toolkit.Service composition refers to the aggregation ofservices to build complex applications to achieve clientrequirements. It is an important challenge to make itpossible for users to construct complex workflowstransparently and thereby insulating them from thecomplexity of interacting with numerousheterogeneous services. We present an extension to theTriana PSE to facilitate graphical Web servicediscovery, composition and invocation. Our frameworkhas several novel features which distinguish it fromother work in this area. First, users can graphicallycreate complex service compositions. Second, Trianaallows the user to share the composite service as aBPEL4WS graph or expose it as a service in a one-clickmanner. Third, Triana allows the user to easilycarry out "what-if" analysis by altering existingworkflows. Fourth, Triana allows the user to recordprovenance data for a workflow. Finally, ourframework allows the user to execute the composedgraph on a Grid or P2P network. Triana is a part ofthe GridLab and GridOneD projects and is used in theGEO 600 project.
