On Improving Performance and Conserving Power in Cluster-Based Web Servers.With the growing use of cluster systems in web servers, filedistribution and database transactions, power conservationand efficiency have been identified as critical issues in thedesign of cluster systems. Widely adopted, distributor-basedsystems forward client requests to a balanced set of backendservers in complete transparency to the clients. In this paper,we use power and locality-based request distribution at the distributor to provide optimum power conservation, whilemaintaining the required QoS of the system. The distributionscheme uses a simple memory management technique using pinned memory on the backend servers and proactive distribution,with the aid of data organization of the website, to improve the locality of the files. A simple on-off based power managementscheme is applied to conserve power. Our scheme provides reducedresponse time to the clients and improved power conservation atthe backend server cluster without compromising performance. Simulations involving real-time web traces and latest web technologieswitness performance boost of 15-23% and power conservation of15-48% over the existing policies.
