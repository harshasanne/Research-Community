Searching Service Repositories by Combining Semantic and Ontological Matching.In this paper, we explore the use of domainindependent and domain-specific ontologies to find matching service descriptions.The domainindependent relationships are derived using an English thesaurus after tokenization and part-of-speech tagging. Thedomain-specific ontological similarity is derived by an inferenceon the semantic annotations associated with web service descriptions.Matches due to the two cues are combined to determine an overall semantic similarity score. By combining multiple cues, we show thatbetter relevancy results can be obtained for service matches from alarge repository, than could be obtained using any one cue alone.
