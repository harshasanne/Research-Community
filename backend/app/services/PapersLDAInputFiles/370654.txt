WSMX - A Semantic Service-Oriented Architecture.Web Services offer an interoperability model that abstracts from theidiosyncrasies of specific implementations; they were introduced toaddress the increasing need for seamless interoperability betweensystems in the Business-to-Business domain. We analyse the require- ments from this domain and show that to fully address interoperabilitydemands we need to make use of semantic descriptions of Web Services. We therefore introduce the Web Service Execution Environment (WSMX), a software system that enables the creation and executionof Semantic Web Services based on the Web Service Modelling Ontology.Providers can use it to register and offer their services and requesterscan use it to dynamically discover and invoke relevant services. WSMX allows a requester to discover, mediate and invoke Web Services in orderto carry out its tasks, based on services available on the Internet.
