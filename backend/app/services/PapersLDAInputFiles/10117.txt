An Open Standard Description Language for Semantic Grid Services Assembly for Autonomic Computing Overlay.Over the coming years, many are anticipating grid computing infrastructure, utilities and services to become an integral part of future socio-economical fabric. However, factors such as; cost of access, reliability and dependability of the technology will undoubtedly influence its adoption and widespread. Though, IBM between the many are promoting autonomic computing as a solution to alleviate such concerns by delegating software systems' own management, security, reliability and performance tuning to the software itself. Based on an on-going research work, focusing on high-assurance concerns of widely distributed systems, this paper will outline a service-oriented approach and associated service infrastructure description languages, which are used to facilitate the construction and management of ad-hoc federated software services.
