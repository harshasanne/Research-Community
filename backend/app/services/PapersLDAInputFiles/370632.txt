Enterprise Application Integration Using Extensible Web Services.This paper describes an approach to Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) using extensible Web services. The approachis demonstrated by building a real-world application for EAI in thefinancial services domain. Business drivers for and approaches toEAI are presented first.The manifestation of Web services in generaland their role in EAI are discussed next. Financial services domaincharacteristics are presented. Business drivers that entail a strongneed for functional extensibility in the financial services domain aredescribed. Our proposed architecture for EAI which addressesfunctional extensibility is described. This architecture is based on thenotion of extensible Web Services. We then present our implementationof the architecture and practical challenges encountered in EAI. A brief discussion of how our work relates to the current research in Service- Oriented Computing (SOC) and Semantic Web concludes the paper.
