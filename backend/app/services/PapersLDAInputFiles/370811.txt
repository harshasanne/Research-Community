Web Service Authorization Framework.Web Services represent an important technology fordistributed applications and will replace various othertechnologies for distributed application developmentsoon. A lot of problems of the early days of WebServices are solved now. However, for authorizationno appropriate solution is available and ready to use.We define requirements for authorization of WebServices and investigate existing authorizationsolutions concerning these requirements. Based onexisting authorization solutions and the definedrequirements, a Web Service Authorization frameworkis developed. We describe concepts and the design ofthe proposed framework and give an overview ofselected implementation aspects (e.g. authorizationdata access, descriptive deployment). The frameworkemphasizes easy deployment of Web Serviceauthorization and is ready to use. Practical experienceusing the framework concludes the paper.
