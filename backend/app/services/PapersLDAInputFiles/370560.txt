Verifiable Web Services with Hierarchical Interfaces.We propose an Hierarchical StateMachine (HSM) model for specifyingbehavioral interfaces of peers participating in a composite web service.We integrate the HSM model to a design pattern which is supportedby a modular verification technique that can 1) statically analyze theproperties about global interactions of a composite web service and 2) check the conformance of the Java implementations of the participantpeers to their interfaces. We extend the synchronizability analysis toHSMs to efficiently identify composite web services whose globalinteractions can be analyzed with respect to unbounded queues usingfinite state model checkers. We also discuss automated translation ofbehavioral interfaces specified as HSMs to BPEL specifications to bepublished and used by other services.
