Process as a Service.We investigate the design of a limited feedback mechanism for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast systems that are equipped with automatic repeat request (ARQ) capabilities. Given multiple antennas at the base-station (BS) and single antenna subscribers, we focus on maximizing the ergodic system sum capacity and propose an adaptive feedback bit allocation scheme under the constraint of total feedback bandwidth. Furthermore, we develop two efficient feedback allocation schemes based on asymptotic analysis. We present simulation results that verify the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive allocation schemes.
