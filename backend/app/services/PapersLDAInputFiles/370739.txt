Policy Lifecycle and Policy Enabled Telecom Open Service Delivery Platform.Policies provide flexible grammar to describe the capabilities,requirements and general characteristics. In loosely-coupledweb services domain, policy has been considered as a possiblemechanism to describe the characteristics of services, associateand evolve with these services dynamically. However there lacksa systematic framework to take into account the employment ofpolicies in web services as a whole. In this paper, based on thelifecycle of policies, a general policy framework for web servicesis proposed, including policy generation, enforcement, publication, negotiation and evolution. In different modules of the framework,a set of mechanisms and tools are discussed and presented. At theend of the paper, a policy enabled telecom open service deliveryplatform is presented. Telecom operators open their network capabilities through deploying their services as web services onthe platform, following Parlay X Web Services specification. Third- party value added service providers use WSDL and policies toaccess services. Policy framework, including security policy, reliable messaging policy and other QoS policy management has provedits efficiency in the real world system.
