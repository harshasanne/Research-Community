Logic-based Web Services Composition: From Service Description to Process Model.This paper introduces a method for automatic compositionof Semantic Web services using Linear Logic (LL) theoremproving. The method uses Semantic Web service language(DAML-S) for external presentation of Web services,while, internally, the services are presented by extralogicalaxioms and proofs in LL. We use a process calculus topresent the composite service formally. The process calculusis attached to the LL inference rules in the style of typetheory. Thus the process model for a composite service canbe generated directly from the proof. The subtyping rulesthat are used for semantic reasoning are presented with LLinference figures. We propose a system architecture wherethe DAML-S translator, the LL theorem prover and the semanticreasoner can operate together to fulfill the task. Thisarchitecture has been implemented in Java.
