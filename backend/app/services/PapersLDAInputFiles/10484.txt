wsrbench: An On-Line Tool for Robustness Benchmarking.Testing web services for robustness is a difficult task. In fact, existing development support tools do not provide any practical mean to assess web services robustness in the presence of erroneous inputs. Previous works proposed that web services robustness testing should be based on a set of robustness tests (i.e., invalid web services call parameters) that are applied in order to discover both programming and design errors. Web services can be classified based on the failure modes observed. In this paper we present and discuss the architecture and use of an on-line tool that provides an easy interface for web services robustness testing. This tool is publicly available and can be used by both web services providers (to assess the robustness of their web services code) and consumers (to select the services that best fit their requirements). The tool is demonstrated by testing several web services available in the Internet.
