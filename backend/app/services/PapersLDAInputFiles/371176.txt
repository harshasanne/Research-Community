Integrating Information-Providing Web Services into the Data Integration System.In order to naturally incorporate the information provided by Web Services into the data integration systems, we propose a novel model, Uniform Query, to uniformly describe the data query/view and the semantic of information-providing Web Services. With the proper matching algorithm we have implemented a prototype in which Web Services act as normal data sources (e.g. RDF datasets), and data queries could be answered through dynamic invocation of matched services.
