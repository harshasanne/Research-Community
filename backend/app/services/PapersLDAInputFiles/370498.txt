Managing and Securing Web Services with VPNs.Web Services constitute a set of technologies thatmany believe will change the web communication landscapewithin the next few years. They offer standardized andeasy communications for distributed systems over the Internet.However their dynamic and distributed naturerequires a well-managed system, and pending security issuesprevent their widespread adoption. Meanwhile thereis a big rage toward the use of Virtual Private Networks(VPNs) to secure communications in a cost-effective environmentlike the Internet. In this paper we explain howto merge these two technologies in a new powerful hybridmodel that: (1) enables an easy management of web services,(2) provides web services security thanks to the useof dynamic and programmable VPNs, and (3) remains simpleand fully integrated.
