2005 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2005) 11-15 July 2005 Orlando FL USAThis paper proposes a new chase based multiuser detection scheme for MIMO-CDMA systems. The proposed approach provides performance gain by concentrating on improving the detection accuracy of the weakest symbol. Compared to the layered space-time multiuser detector (LAST-MUD), the proposed scheme can achieve substantial performance improvement, especially, when the number of transmit antennas is equal to the number of receive antennas. The comparison between our scheme and another chase based scheme, the B-Chase detector, which was originally proposed for improving the performance of the vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) system, is also presented. The problem existing in the B-Chase detector is the criterion for selecting the weakest symbol. In our scheme, a more reasonable selection criterion is proposed. We show that the proposed scheme has less complexity than the B-Chase detector but with the tendency of achieving better performance at high SNR.
