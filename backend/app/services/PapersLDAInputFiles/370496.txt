Configuration-Based Workflow Composition.Automatic or assisted workflow composition is a field of intenseresearch for applications to the world wide web or to businessprocess modeling. Workflow composition is traditionally addressedin various ways, generally via theorem proving techniques. The originality of this research stems from the observation that buildinga composite workflow bears strong relationships with finite model search,and that some workflow languages can be defined as constrainedobject metamodels [1], [2]. This leads to consider the viability ofapplying configuration techniques to this problem. Our main contribution is to prove the feasibility of such an approach, with some advantagesand drawbacks compared to logical based techniques. We present a constrained object model for workflow composition, based upon a metamodel for workflows and ontologies for processesand data flows. Experimental results are listed for a working implementationthat generates complex interleaving composite workflows involvingtransformations, synchronization and branching constructs.
