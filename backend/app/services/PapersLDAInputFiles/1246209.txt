Patterns for Enterprise Mashups in B2B Collaborations to Foster Lightweight Composition and End User Development.The huge demand for situational and ad-hoc applications desired by the mass of business end users cannot be fully implemented by IT departments. New approaches that allow for End User Development (EUD) are needed to overcome this ���long-tail�۝ dilemma. More specifically,most existing approaches insufficiently support EUD for infrequent, situational, and ad-hoc B2B Collaborations.Enterprise Mashup-/ and Lightweight Composition approaches and tools are promising solutions to unleash the huge potential of integrating the mass of users into development. Within the current research project FAST,a Web based Mashup/ Gadget development tool is in development that allows for different options to realizeB2B collaborations via Mashups. In this work, five patterns for the development of Enterprise Mashups are identified, characterized, and evaluated with focus on their adequacy for B2B collaborations.
