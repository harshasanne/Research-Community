Text to Intelligence: Building and Deploying a Text Mining Solution in the Services Industry for Customer Satisfaction Analysis.We present our experiences in building and deploying a text mining solution in services industry settings, specifically in contact centers. We describe the Voice of Customer (VoC) and Customer Satisfaction (C-Sat) analysis settings and outline several unique research challenges brought about by this confluence of text mining and industrial services research. We describe our system for integrated \tc{}, business intelligence and interactive text labeling for C-Sat analysis. We recount invaluable lessons learned as computer science researchers in services research engagements.
