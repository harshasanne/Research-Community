A Security Meta-model for Service-Oriented Architectures.Services account for a major part of the IT industry today. Companies increasingly like to focus on their core expertise area and use IT services to address all their peripheral needs. Services Computing is a new science which aims to study and better understand the foundations of this highly popular industry. It covers the science and technology of leveraging computing and information technology to model, create, operate, and manage business services. Since 2004, the International Conference on Services Computing (SCC) has provided a platform for practitioners to present the latest advances in services science. Like its predecessors, SCC 2009 will contribute in building the pillars of this important science and shaping the future of Service Computing.Services Computing currently shapes the thinking of business modeling, business consulting, solution creation, service delivery, and software architecture design, development and deployment. The global nature of Services Computing leads to many opportunities and challenges and creates a new networked economic structure for supporting different business models. SCC 2009 will help in bridging the gap between business services and information technology by driving research in technologies such as service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process integration and management, service engineering and grid/utility computing and Web 2.0. The theme of the conference is "Innovation in Globally Integrated Services". SCC 2009 will have the following major tracks: Foundations of Services Computing, Service Computing Practices and Applications and Business Aspects of Service Computing.SCC 2009 is sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Services Computing. SCC 2004 was held in Shanghai, China, September 15-18, 2004 . SCC 2005 was co-located with ICWS 2005 on July 11-15, 2005 in Orlando, Florida, USA. SCC 2006 was co-located with ICWS 2006 on September 18-22, 2006 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. SCC 2007 was co-located with ICWS 2007 on July 9-13, 2007 in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. SCC 2008 was held on July 8-11, 2008, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA. The SCC Proceedings has been included in EI Compendex.SCC 2009 will concentrate on the science and technology of Business/Application Services and the bridging technologies such as Business Strategy and Design, Business Process Integration and Management, Grid and Utility Computing, and SOA Services and Solutions; while the 2009 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2009) will continue to put its focus on all aspects of Web based services from infrastructure and application perspectives; IEEE Congress on Services (SERVICES 2009) covers innovations in all vertical services industries and education agenda.
