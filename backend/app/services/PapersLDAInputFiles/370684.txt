Shared Data Services: An Architectural Approach.The growing need for enterprises to have instantaneous accessand visibility to data is fuelling the need for enterprise data integration.An enterprise having fragmented systems on varied technologies is a very commonly occurring scenario. In this paper we take a businesscase scenario with heterogeneous systems and describe a non- intrusive service oriented approach for achieving enterprise widedata integration. We take a holistic view of the problem statementand propose an end to end architectural approach that encompassesthe ETL activities to the shared data access layer. This meta-databased architecture is highly extensible requiring minimal change inexisting applications and business process yet adhering to the longterm architectural strategy. We also propose the creation of fine grainedshared business services which are supported by underlying shared dataservices.
