A Dynamic Data Structure for Geospatial Web Services Integration.This paper investigates the issues whenseveral complementary geospatial web services arechained to be a customized application process. Thispaper proposes a conceptual framework and a datastructure, called Service Chain Graph (SCG), todescribe the geospatial web service integration and thedynamic construction of service chaining process. Aset of dynamic structural transformation rules is givento model the dynamic process of service chaining.Implementation issues are discussed and a prototypesystem is briefly presented for integration of severaldistributed, heterogeneous geospatial data servicesbased on the model proposed by this paper.
