Automatic Composition of Web Services with Contingency Plans.The semantic Web technology and the Web servicesdescription language extensibility may be combined todescribe services in an unambiguous and machineinterpretable way, automating Web services discovery,selection and invocation. In this paper, we present analgorithm and a prototype for the automaticcomposition of Web services that implement workflowsdescribed in a high level language. Our approach hasmany advantages comparing to the manual creation ofa simple program composition, such as smallerimplementation time and cost, reliability with thegeneration of contingency plans, greater capacity toevolve with the dynamic service discovery, and fasterexecution time with the use of heuristics. We use theOWL-S ontology to semantically describe Web servicesmetadata and indexes to help selecting them. Theproposed algorithm considers that equivalent servicesmay have different interfaces and also respectspreferences of the users.
