Evaluating the Process Control-Flow Complexity Measure.Process measurement is the task of empirically and objectivelyassigning numbers to the attributes of processes in such a wayas to describe them. We define process complexity as the degreeto which a process is difficult to analyze, understand or explain.One way to analyze a processï¿½_ complexity is to use a process control-flow complexity measure. This measure analyzes the control- flow of processes and can be applied to both Web processes andworkflows. In this paper, we discuss how to evaluate the control- flow complexity measure to ensure that it can be qualify as a good and comprehensive one.
