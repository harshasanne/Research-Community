Weaving Aspects into Web Service Orchestrations.Web Service orchestration engines need to be more open to enablethe addition of new features into service-based applications. In thispaper, we illustrate how, in a BPEL engine with aspect-weavingcapabilities, a process-driven application based on the Google Web Service can be dynamically adapted with new features and hot-fixedto meet unforeseen post-deployment requirements. Business processes(the application skeletons) can be enriched with additional featuressuch as debugging, execution monitoring, or an application-specific GUI. Dynamic aspects are also used on the processes themselves to tacklethe problem of hot-fixes to long running processes. In this manner,composing a Web Service 'on-the-fly' means weaving its choreography in- terface into the business process.
