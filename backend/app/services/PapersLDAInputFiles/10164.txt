Interaction and Coordination for Distributed Grid Computing.The programming model of the current distributed systems such as middleware CORBA or JAVA RMI is based on remote procedure call. Without the support of high-level API for coordination, developing real-world distributed grid applications in this model is difficult. In this paper, we present an algorithm for multiparty interaction, a key abstraction of distributed coordination for the future distributed grid programming.
