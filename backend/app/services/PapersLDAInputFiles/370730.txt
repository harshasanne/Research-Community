WS-I Basic Profile: A Practitioner's View.Interoperability refers to the ability of software andhardware on multiple machines from multiple vendorsto communicate with each other without significantchanges on either side. Web services streamlineenterprise application integration by making it easierto tie applications running on heterogeneous platformstogether helping them communicate correctly,effectively and at reduced cost. The difficulty ofintegration is a function of the level of interoperabilitybetween the applications being integrated. Eventhough there are established standards for webservices messaging (SOAP), description (WSDL) anddiscovery and registry (UDDI), customimplementations of these protocols by individualvendors has led to various interoperability issues. WebServices Interoperability Organization (WS-I) recentlyreleased Basic Profile 1.0, addressing theinteroperability issues with core web servicesstandards. In this paper, we look at some of the keyweb services interoperability issues pointed out bypractitioners and critically examine how Basic Profile1.0 addresses them. Further we also examine somelimitations of the profile. We conclude by evaluating apopular web services implementation against theprofile and present our observations.
