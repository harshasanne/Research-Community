Beyond SOA: Context-Aware Composite Services.Context Aware Services are the next generation of the Service Computing Paradigm. In this Industry report we explore a case study of creating contextaware services for the telecommunications industry. The SOA paradigm is a logical means of building and exposing context aware services in the form of composite applications. Context-Aware Services can be exemplified by the ability of a pre-programed cellphone to detect your current location, collate this with a time of day, city and events such as lunch or dinner along with the preferences of cuisine. It can then inform you as you are walking down a street that your favorite Chinese cuisine can be found using the following directions. A Service-oriented Architecture (SOA) is usually context-free. The addition of relevant context-based information about user profiles, rules pertaining to an industry (such as telco) domain allows the integration of domain-specific languages into the SOA paradigm by defining a set of production rules that the context will use to determine the course of action(s) to take as events are coming in (e.g., through the Business Mobility Platform described in this paper).
