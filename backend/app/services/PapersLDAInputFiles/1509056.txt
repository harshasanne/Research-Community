2004 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2004) 15-18 September 2004 Shanghai ChinaElevation maps are a widely used spatial data representation in geographical information systems (GIS). Paths on elevation maps can be characterized by profiles, which describe relative elevation as a function of distance. In this research, we address the inverse of this mapping - given a profile, how to efficiently find paths that could have generated it. This is called the profile query problem. Profiles have a wide variety of uses that include registering tracking information, or even other maps, to a given map. We describe a probabilistic model to characterize the maximal likelihood that a point lying on a path matches the query profile. Propagation of such probabilities to neighboring points can effectively prune the search space. This model enables us to efficiently answer queries of arbitrary profiles with user-specified error tolerances. When compared to existing spatial index methods, our approach supports more flexible queries with orders of magnitude speedup.
