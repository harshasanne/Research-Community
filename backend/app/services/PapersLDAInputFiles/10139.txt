Domain Decomposition for Applications Based on CFD-Grid .Domain decomposition (D-D) is a key element for most Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) parallel computing.For the load balance of computer nodes, the difference of computer nodes is considered in D-D. A domain decomposition Service is now provided on CFD-Grid.This Service also can be embedded in other applications based on CFD-Grid.
