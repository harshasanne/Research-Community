Behavior Descriptions of Mobile Agents for Web Services Integration.Web Services technology for interoperability, dynamicdiscovery and integration of distributed components is to beapplied in various environments, such as networks of relatively narrow and unstable wireless connections. However, in such environments it is necessary to deal with resourcelimitation. Our work adopts mobile agent technology in response to this problem and presents a mobile agent framework for Web Services integration. This framework utilizesBPEL (Business Process Execution Language for Web Services) for description of the integration logic, and provides declarative descriptions for physical behaviors (migrationand cloning). This facilitates addition or change of physicalbehaviors according to the environmental conditions whilepreserving the integration logic. This paper especially focuses on formal definition and discussion of our framework.
