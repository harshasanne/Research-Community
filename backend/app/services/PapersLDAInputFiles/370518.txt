Global and Local QoS Constraints Guarantee in Web Service Selection.In Service Oriented Architectures, complex applications arecomposed from a variety of functionally equivalent Web serviceswhich may differ for quality parameters. Under this scenario,applications are defined as high level business processes andservice composition can be implemented dynamically by identifyingthe best set of services available at run time. In this paper, we modelthe service composition problem as a mixed integer linear problem where both local constraints and global constraints can be specified.
