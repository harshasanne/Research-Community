External Matching in UDDI.As an industry-backed registry for Web Services,UDDI plays an important role in helping requesters findsuitable services. Unfortunately, the current searchfunctions in UDDI are limited in their support for makingautomatic service selection decisions. While someapproaches have been suggested to enhance the searchcapabilities in UDDI using service semantics, they sufferfrom limitations. These approaches either prescribeperforming semantic matching outside of UDDI leaving itssearch function unchanged or propose embedding aspecific matching engine within UDDI thereby making thesearch function inflexible. In this work, we present aflexible mechanism to enhance UDDI's search function.Using our approach, users can integrate multiple externalmatching services with a UDDI registry to support multipleexternal service description languages. The result is aUDDI registry with flexible and intelligent service searchfunction that can be used for dynamic service selection.
