Constraint Specification and Processing in Web Services Publication and Discovery.Much effort is being made by the IT industry towardsthe establishment of a Web services infrastructure andthe refinement of its component technologies to enablethe sharing of heterogeneous application resources.Traditional roles of the service provider, servicerequestor and service broker and their interactionsare now being improved upon to enable more effectiveservices.The implementation of the Web Service broker iscurrently limited to being an interface to the servicerepository for service registration, browsing and/orprogrammatic access. In this work, we have extendedthe functionality of the Web services broker to includeconstraint specification and processing, which enablesthe broker to find a good match between a serviceprovider's capabilities and a service requestor'srequirements. This paper presents the extension madeto the Web Services Description Language to includeconstraint specifications in service descriptions andrequests, the architecture of a Constraint-basedBroker, the constraint matching technique, someimplementation details, and preliminary evaluation results.
