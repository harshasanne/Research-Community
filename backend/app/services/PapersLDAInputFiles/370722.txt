A Grammar-Based Index for Matching Business Processes.Complex services are composed of simple services which typicallyneed to be processed in a particular order. Two complex servicesonly match if they agree on both, their simple services and theirprocessing order. This matching semantics can be formalized bymeans of modelling complex services as finite state automata (FSAs),and analysing the intersection of the FSAs. However, computingthe intersection of FSAs is computationally expensive, and thus does not scale for large service repositories. This paper presentsan approach for indexing and matching complex services using anabstraction that transforms the underlying FSA via its grammar intoa form that can be indexed using available index mechanisms.Evaluation of this approach shows a performance gain of severalorders of magnitude as compared to sequential matching.
