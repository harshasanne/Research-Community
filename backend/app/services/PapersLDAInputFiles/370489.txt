A Multi-Agents System to Implement E-Business.Although EDI (electronic data Interchange) have provided auseful method to the automated message Interchanging betweenenterprises, this method costs a lot of money and resources, thereis a new technology named ebXML(Electronic Business usingeXtensible Markup Language) BPSS(Business Process SpecificationSchema) which provides a more easy way to integrate the wholebusiness process. Ebxml BPSS supports the specification of theset of elements required to configure a runtime system in order toexecute a set of ebXML business transactions. Ebxml BPSSdescribes which message should be interchanged and how tointerchange, and provides a set of specification for the process automation. In this study, we propose a federated multi-agentssystem, which can implement the business process, and describea detailed mechanism to apply the BPS to a prototypeimplementation.
