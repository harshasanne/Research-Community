Middleware Architecture for Evaluation and Selection of 3rd-Party Web Services for Service Providers.This paper presents an architecture to facilitate efficient evaluationand selection of 3rd party web services for service providers.Most service provider architectures have primarily focused onproviding web service front ends to legacy systems, aggregatingand delivering services via workflows. These architectures primarily considered static business contracts between the service providerand its (web-service enabled) business partners. This approach makes these architectures inflexible to variations in business requirement, partners' performance and customer requirements. Our architecture provides a flexible means for service providers tooptimize business performance. Based on the historical performance,extant context, and optimising business rules, the appropriate serviceis selected and invoked to serve a customer request. We havedeveloped a prototype system ODSS-in-ENDS, that demonstrates this capability.
