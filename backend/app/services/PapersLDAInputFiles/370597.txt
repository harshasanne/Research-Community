Service-Oriented Development and Integration: Toward Web Services-Based Business Information Systems.The objective of this research is to seek the exact nature of howan organization should apply a serviceoriented design to systemsthat were previously standalone heterogeneous applications. For this objective, three applications are developed and integrated by usinga service-oriented architecture: a biometric attendance system, asurveillance system, and a point of sale system. Each application is classified by a combination of two properties: input or output heavyapplication, local or remote running application. Based upon thecombination, two types of service-oriented integration approach, fullyor partially web serviced integration, are suggested according to theextent of the usage of web services. Based upon the experiencesgained from developing the three applications, the guidelines for adoptingweb services are proposed when an organization is integrating applications.
