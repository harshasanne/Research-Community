UML-Based Modeling and Validity Checking of Web Service Descriptions.Web services are software systems designed to support interoperablemachine-to-machine interaction over a network. WSDL descriptions,often characterized as IDLs for Web services, are a key for Web service interoperability. Therefore, special care should be takenin designing WSDL descriptions. We present an approach thatprovides UML-based support to design and validate WSDLdescriptions. To promote Web service interoperability, WS -I organization provides a Basic Profile that defines clarifications,refinements, interpretations and amplifications of Web servicespecifications, including WSDL. We propose UML-based profiles to define structural rules of WSDL documents as well as Basic Profilerecommendations for WSDL descriptions. These profiles can be usedto guide the user in designing correct and Basic Profile compliantWSDL descriptions and to check the validity of existing WSDLdescriptions. We propose a method and tools for such validity checking,and demonstrate the applicability of the approach with a case study.
