Redundant-Free Web Services Composition Based on a Two-Phase Algorithm.Web services composition search systems have received a great deal of attention recently. However, current solutions have limitations of inefficiency and including redundant web services in the results. In this paper, we proposed a redundant-free web services composition search based on a two phase algorithm. In the forward phase, the candidate composition will be found efficiently by searching the Link Index. In the backward phase, redundant-free web services compositions are generated from the candidate composition by using the concepts of tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the performance benefits of our proposed techniques compared to state-of-the-art composition approaches.
