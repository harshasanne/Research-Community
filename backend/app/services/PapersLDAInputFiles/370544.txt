Transparent Caching for Nomadic WS Clients.As mobile devices become more pervasive they will emerge as astandard platform for hosting Web Service clients. Unlike their "static" counterparts, mobile devices are typically connected via a wirelessnetwork forcing them to deal with constrained bandwidth and the sudden loss of connectivity. This paper focuses on the use of caching SOAP request-responsepairs in order to compensate for fluctuating bandwidth and loss ofconnectivity. We introduce the concept of embedded SOAP caching, highlighting the need for meta-data as a means to support it. A novelSOAP cache (CRISP) that can be embedded into the application orused as an independent proxy-cache is presented and evaluated under various loads and settings. The evaluation of CRISP showsthat caching of SOAP traffic is not only an effective means to compensatefor loss of connectivity but also enables reducing network loads which is particularly interesting when dealing with bandwidth constraintwireless connections.
