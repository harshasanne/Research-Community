Towards Intelligent Web Services for Automating Medical Service Composition.The vision of the Semantic Web is to reduce manualdiscovery and usage of Web resources (documents andservices) and to allow software agents to automaticallyidentify these Web resources, integrate them and executethem for achieving the intended goals of the user. Such acomposed Web service may be represented as a workflow,called service flow. Current studies of Web services are notsufficient for automatic composition. This paper presentsdifferent types of compositional knowledge required forWeb service discovery and composition: syntactic, semanticand pragmatic knowledge. As a proof of concept, wehave implemented our framework in a cardiovascular domainwhich requires advanced service discovery and compositionacross heterogeneous platforms of multiple organizations.Within this framework, we describe (1) How torepresent the compositional knowledge, which plays a rolein service discovery and composition, in DAML-S; (2) Howheterogeneous medical services interoperate in a composedmedical service flow. (3) To solve this knowledge level integration,we build on an ontology integration method calledSEMIO (Semantic Interoperability).
