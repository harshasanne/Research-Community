2008 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2008) 8-11 July 2008 Honolulu Hawaii USAIn this paper an efficient copyright protection watermarking algorithm is proposed. By embedding orthogonal vector into the wavelet-tree structure of the host image, we get the watermarked image. At the same time human vision system is considered to get perceptual results. We design an elaborate function for blind watermarking scheme. This function can dynamically determine the embedding position. The theory and experimental results show that our method successfully survives image processing operation, noise adding, the JPEG lossy compression and image cropping. Especially, the scheme is robust towards image sharpening and image enhancement.
