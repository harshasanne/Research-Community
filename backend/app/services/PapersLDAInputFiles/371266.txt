SWFilter: Semantic Web Services Filtering System.Web services search and discovery systems have received a great deal of attention recently. However, little attention has been given to a web services filtering system. In this paper, we propose a design and architecture of a semantic web services filtering system called SWFilter. SWFilter uses Prufer sequences transformed from web services and user queries. The filtering process is performed in a bottomup manner. Ontology information and compositions of web services are also considered in the filtering process.
