A Distributed e-Education System Based on the Service Oriented Architecture.Large-scale distributed system, such as educational system, are difficult to develop due to their complex and decentralized nature. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a new form of distributed software architecture. The Service Oriented Architecture facilitates the development of such systems by supporting modular design, application integration and interoperation, and software reuse. With open standards, such as XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI, the Service Oriented Architecture supports interoperability between services operating on different platforms and between applications implemented in different programming languages. In this paper, In this paper, we propose software architecture for design and develop for a distributed e-education system in the way of service oriented architecture. We will explain what this e-education system concerns, how it is developed, and what services it provides.
