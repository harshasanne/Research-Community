Response Time Histograms for Composite Web Services.Probabilistic duration representations can be used toforecast the response time of (composite) web services,based on empirical data of past executions or calculatedfrom control flow structures.The capability to choose thefastest among similar services or to optimize servicesbased on probable process execution times are only twopossible application areas.
