Grid Resources for Industrial Applications.We introduce Grid Resources for IndustrialApplications (GRIA), a project that aims to enablecommercial use of the Grid. GRIA enables serviceproviders to rent out spare CPU cycles, and clients tohire those CPU cycles. Web services play a key role in thearchitecture of GRIA, chiefly through theirinteroperability and security features - they provide awell-defined means of limiting clients' access to discreteoperations, thus allowing clients to do "work" on aremote application server without giving them full shellaccess to the server. In this paper, we focus onrequirements, business processes and security, andinteroperability and standardisation issues raised by thiswork. We also describe some of the lessons learnedthrough experience of designing, implementing anddeploying a prototype system, GRIA v1.
