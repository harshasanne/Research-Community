Web Services for a Semantic Web Integrated Architecture.Semantic Web and Heterogeneous Data Integration are critical factors for the future web intelligence. A fundamental aspect of this challenge is the provision of a wide and disseminated platform of abstract resources that permit us to get the right information at the right time. We are researching a Semantic Web integrated, virtual and dynamic architecture. This paper proposes a Web Service Architecture as the preliminary implementation guideline for such a semantically integrated one.
