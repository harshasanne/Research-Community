Protocol-Based Business Process Modeling and Enactment.Business processes are conventionally modeled as monolithicflows that capture the desired business logic. However,developing process flows is challenging. Because aflow specifies what its participants should do, it restrictsthe autonomy of its participants, thus limiting their abilityto exploit opportunities or accommodate exceptions accordingto their business preferences.We take a dual perspective wherein business processesare modeled as compositions of (instantiated) business protocols.Each business protocol specifies interactions amongits partners; each protocol serves a unique business purpose,e.g., processing a payment or shipping an item. Thus,modularizing a monolithic business process via businessprotocols allows clear separation of concerns for modelingand enacting the process.We develop an approach in which protocols are compiledinto local skeletal flows for each participant that can befleshed out with local business logic as needed. Such flowsare naturally distributed but can be enacted using commercialbusiness flow engines. Thus, our protocol-based approachcombines the benefit of improved modeling with simplifiedimplementations.
