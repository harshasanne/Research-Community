Enhancing Semantic Web Services Composition with User Interaction.The semantic web services composition process arranges several web services into one composite to realize complex workflows. To do this, semantic metadata of web services' description are used. The current approaches based mainly on AI planning are immature to be used in practice. In this paper we propose an approach involving users in the semantic web services composition to help overcome problems occurring in the composition process. The basic idea is to find the users helpful in situations when preconditions are not satisfied or some input data are not available which are in demand to create a composition.
