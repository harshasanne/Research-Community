Extending the Web Services Model to IT Services.Web Services and Service Oriented Architecture(SOA) represent a radical departure from traditionalmonolithic, tightly bound, customized applicationswith proprietary interfaces. Their range however islimited as yet by the very structure and standardizationwhich support their interoperability. While they areable to support heterogeneity of technical components,their ability to support complex business interactionshas yet to mature. This poster summarizes research inprogress which asks how might the Web Servicesmodel be mapped to other kinds of IT services andextended to account for services of greater human andorganizational complexity through their lifecycle. Theresearch proposes the construction of a generic ITservice model and a taxonomy IT services to provide aframe of reference for analysis and evaluation for theextension of the Web Services model and for atransition to a service oriented view of IT.
