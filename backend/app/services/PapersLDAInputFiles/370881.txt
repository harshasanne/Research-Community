Fresco: A Web Services based Framework for Configuring Extensible SLA Management Systems.A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a service contract that includesthe evaluation criteria for agreed service quality standards. Sinceagreeable specifications on the evaluation criteria cannot be limitedin practice, competitiveSLA management products must be extensiblein terms of their support for contract-specific SLA compliance evaluations.While the need of running and managing those software products asservices increases, we have found that developing a good solution forconfiguring them as per contractual terms is a challenging task. Thispaper presents the Fresco framework,which facilitates configuringextensible SLA management systems using Web Services. An XML- based specification of SLA management related data called SCOL willalso be presented to show how the framework supports contract- specific SLA terms and contract-specific extensions of the deployedSLA management software. The paper furthermore shows how theFresco system uses a template-based approach to communicate withother Web Services applications with support for various input and outputformats. Our experience with implementing the Fresco framework fora leading commercial SLA management software product demonstratesthat the framework facilitates the creation of effective and efficient solutionsfor configuring extensible SLA management systems.
