Domain-Specific Web Service Discovery with Service Class Descriptions.This paper presents DynaBot, a domain-specific web servicediscovery system. The core idea of the DynaBot service discovery system is to use domain-specific service class descriptions poweredby an intelligent Deep Web crawler. In contrast to current registry- based service discovery systems -- like the several available UDDIregistries -- DynaBot promotes focused crawling of the Deep Web ofservices and discovers candidate services that are relevant to thedomain of interest. It uses intelligent filtering algorithms to match servicesfound by focused crawling with the domain-specific service classdescriptions. We demonstrate the capability of DynaBot through theBLAST scenario and describe our initial experience with DynaBot.
