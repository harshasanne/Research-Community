A Method for Composing Process of Non-deterministic Web Services.Web services have been common technologies forproviding services over the Internet. In the future, it isexpected that a usage model that autonomouslyintegrates services will become ordinary in, forexample, B2B integration. However, such method ofexecuting pre-defined process lacks flexibility becausea service requestor must know in advance the interfaceof all integrated services. Accordingly, there is a needfor a method that composes a process from therequestor's requirement independent of the interface ofservices.This paper proposes the architecture and a methodfor composing a process automatically. Our approachis formulating web services function and a requestor'srequirement as the transitions of his state by means ofsituation calculus and calculating what process ismatched with the requirement. In our method, wemodel message-oriented execution of service.Moreover, our method is capable of composing not justa sequential process but also a process includingconditional choices. Therefore, our method has thebasic feature to be able to compose non-deterministicweb service.
