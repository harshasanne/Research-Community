Improving WS-Security Performance with a Template-Based Approach.The poor performance of WS-Security (WSS) processing isoften a topic of concern and prevents its wider adoption. Wefocused on byte-level similarities in WSS messages and implementeda template-based WSS processor. Inside the processor anautomaton is employed that matches the incoming messagesand extracts signature values and/or encrypted values. WSS operations including XML Canonicalization are performed againstthe extracted values, without costly XML parsing and traversal.This is more than twice as fast as the DOM-based WSS processorand our prior work with a stream-based processor.
