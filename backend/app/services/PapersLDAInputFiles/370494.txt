Access Control for Semantic Web Services.In this paper, we present an approach to enable accesscontrol for semantic web services. Our approach buildson the idea of autonomous granting of access rights, decision making based on independent trust structures and respects privacy requirements of the users. Our framework allows the specification and computation of complex access control policies in a manageable and efficient way. Therefore, our approach is useful not only in webservices based applications (typically client-server architecture)but also in peer to peer and agent based applications.
