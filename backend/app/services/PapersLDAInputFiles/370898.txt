Transforming BPEL into Annotated Deterministic Finite State Automata for Service Discovery.Web services advocate loosely coupled systems, althoughcurrent loosely coupled applications are limitedto stateless services. The reason for this limitation is thelack of a method supporting matchmaking of state dependentservices exemplarily specified in BPEL. In particular,the sender's requirement that the receiver must supportall possible messages sent at a certain state arenot captured by models currently used for service discovery.Annotated deterministic finite state automataprovide this expressiveness. In this paper the transformationof a local process specification given in BPELto annotated deterministic finite state automata is presented.
