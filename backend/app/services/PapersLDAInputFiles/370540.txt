Ad-hoc Invocation of Semantic Web Services.We present the Web Service Description Framework(WSDF), which provides both a representationmechanism and a runtime system architecture for semanticallyenriched Web Services. We analyze existinglanguages such as BPEL4WS and OWL-S before addressingtheir deficiencies in our proposal. Our approach allowsa client to invoke a service based solely on a shared ontology,i.e. without prior knowledge on the API, providing animportant building block towards a global, flexible informationinfrastructure. Another main point is that WSDFcan be applied to clients and services written in a conventionalobject oriented programming language. This isachieved by lifting datastructures to an ontology level inwhich rich logical statements about services can be formalized.We also present a detailed system architecturethat covers planning, invocation, and the automatic processingof the service results, which is accomplishedusing the observer design pattern and by asserting the resultin the respective model. Furthermore, the requiredannotations can be specified conveniently by placing commentsin the source code.
