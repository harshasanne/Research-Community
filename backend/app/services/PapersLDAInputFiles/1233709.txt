Design Pattern for Object Triple Mapping.Up to now, developing software for the Semantic Web is much more complex than developing software for other data representation paradigms, such as relational data bases. Software development for relational databases is dram a tically simplified by so-called object-relational map pers. Due to the conceptual difference be tweenrelat ion al databases and the Semantic Web, the design pat terns for object-relational mapping cannot directly be used for lin ked data. In this paper we show how design pat terns for ob ject-relational mapping can be used to achieve the more complex object triple mapping, which will make developing Semantic Web-enabled software much easier.
