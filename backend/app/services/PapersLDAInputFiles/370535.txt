Toward Fundamental Primitives and Infrastructure Enhancements for Distributed Web Object Coordination and Workflows.We envision users discovering suitable web objects and configuringthem on-the-fly with their desired high-level application logic, withthe programming and deployment carried out entirely on the web. Easy configurability and interplay of web entities implies evolution of a fewcommon sense, yet powerful set of core primitives for effective coordination,akin in simplicity and strength to the HTTP protocol. Current webservices technology lacks Infrastructure support, theoretical soundfundamental framework for web services coordination and composition,and easy use tools for web application development. Our Web Coordination Bond system gears towards finding solutions to afore- mentioned research challenges. We have proposed web coordinationbonds as a potential candidate for a set of core artifacts for web service coordination/choreography [2]. Section 2 illustrates the ideasof web coordination bonds. Section 3 introduces the concept of WebProcess Architecture, which is a simple but powerful enhancement tothe web services infrastructure that makes web services stateful,coordination and transaction aware capable enteritis. Section 4describes our BondFlow [5] system, which is a development and deployment platform for collaborative distributed applications overweb objects including web services.
