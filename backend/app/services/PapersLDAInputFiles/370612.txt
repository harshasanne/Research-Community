RAWS: Reflective Engineering for Web Services.Reflection is a powerful tool for the adaptation ofapplications at runtime. The modification of Webservices is a task that entails the modification andcompilation of the source code, as well as thedeployment of the new version of the Web service inthe application server.In this paper, we introduce RAWS (Reflective andAdaptable Web Service), a Web service design modelbased on a reflective architecture of two levels. RAWSallows both the dynamic modification of the definitionand implementation structure of the Web service, andthe dynamic modification of the Web service behaviorin order to change the existing code or to add newfunctionalities. All these dynamic modifications areperformed directly on the code during execution, withno need to have the Web service source code.RAWS improves Web services adaptability andmaintainability, as well as the ability for authorizedclients to remotely modify them.
