Freight Transportation System Based on Web Service.The Third Party Logistics (3PT) is a fast-growing industry in recent years and has a demand for information integration technology. More and more logistics companies find other Web service providers to integrate their application in order to reduce the cost and improve the efficiency. Web service meets their requirement. Web services are self-contained, web-enabled applications capable not only of performing business activities on their own, but also possessing the ability to engage other Web services in order to complete higher-order business transactions. As the main functional part of logistics system, freight transportation system assumes the job of scheduling vehicles for the logistics system to complete the transportation task. In this paper a freight transportation system which is separated from the logistics system is a typical business case. The prototype system developed on J2EE has a quality of cross-platform and interoperability with other systems.
