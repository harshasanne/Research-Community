Compressing SOAP Messages by using Differential Encoding.A major drawback of using SOAP for applicationintegration is its enormous demand for network bandwidth.Compared to classical approaches like Java-RMI and Corba,SOAP messages typically cause more than three times morenetwork traffic. In this paper we will give a detailed surveyof state of the art binary encoding strategies for SOAP andintroduce a new experimental concept for SOAP compression,which makes use of the commonly available WSDL descriptionof a SOAP web service.
