Towards a Foundation for Quantitative Service Analysis.To bridge the gap between the high resolution digital images and limited display capability of mobile devices, this paper proposes a method to automatically transform static images to dynamic video clips to fit the requirement of mobile devices. Face detection and attention region detection techniques are applied to extract important regions that users may be interested in. Then a procedure of video resolution adaptation is performed for different screen size and aspect ratio. An algorithm to imitate camera motions is applied to visit the detected important regions to generate the motion effects. Finally the video clip is encoded with AVS-M standard as an implementation to be displayed on different mobile platforms. The solution provided in this paper can enable users viewing photographs in a dynamic mode using mobile devices that could not only glance over the whole picture of the image automatically, but also enjoy the important details of the photo. Furthermore, vivid dynamic effect enhances the viewing experience of users.
