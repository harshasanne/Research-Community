Extensible Web Services Architecture for Notification in Large-Scale Systems.Existing web services notification and eventing standards are useful in many applications, but they have serious limitations precluding large-scale deployments: it is impossible to use IP multicast or for recipients to forward messages to others and scalable notification trees must be setup manually. We propose1 a design free of such limitations that could serve as a basis for extending or complementing these standards. The approach emerges from our prior work on QSM [1], a new web services eventing platform that can scale to extremely large environments.
