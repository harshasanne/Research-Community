A Dynamic Services Discovery Framework for Traversing Web Services Representation Chain.In this paper, we propose a dynamic servicediscovery framework from Web services representationchain. The major components include Web ServiceChains Pre-categorizing module, Service ExplorationEngine, Services Container, Chain Change Detectionmodule with associated control parameters. From theworking research prototype, our proposed mechanismenables businesses to easily retrieve up-to-date Webservices linked and nested multi-level deep in the servicedescription documents. In addition, a federated Webservices discovery portal is illustrated to show how theresearch results are aggregated from hyperlinked WSILdocuments as well as UDDI registries for achievingmore accurate services exploration result.
