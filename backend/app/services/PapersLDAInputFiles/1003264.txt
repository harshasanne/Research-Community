The Design of QoS Broker Algorithms for QoS-Capable Web Services.QoS (Quality of Service) support in Web services isan important issue. In this paper, we present a QoS-capableweb service architecture, QCWS, byintroducing a QoS broker module between serviceclients and providers (servers). The functions of theQoS broker module include collecting QoS informationabout servers, making selection decisions for clients,and negotiating with servers to get QoS commitments.We propose two resource allocation algorithms (HQand RQ) used by QoS broker when broker acts as thefront-end of a server. The goals of algorithms are tomaximize the server resource usage while minimizingthe QoS instability for each client. The QoSperformance and instability tradeoffs of bothalgorithms are studied by simulation.
