An Algorithm for Web Service Discovery through Their Composition.The web services stack of standards is designed to supportthe reuse and the interoperation of software componentson the web. A critical step in the process of developingapplications based on the service oriented architecture isthe service discovery. This paper shows how servicecomposition can be used as a technique to support servicediscovery. The paper discusses the current state ofresearch in this area and introduces a semantic matchingalgorithm that exploits the possibility to compose multipleservices in order to satisfy a service request.
