Dynamic Data Integration Using Web Services.We address the problem of large-scale dataintegration, where the data sources are unknown atdesign time, are from autonomous organisations, andmay evolve. Experiments are described involving ademonstrator system in the field of health services dataintegration within the UK. Current web servicestechnology has been used extensively and largelysuccessfully in these distributed prototype systems. Thework shows that web services provide a goodinfrastructure layer, but integration demands a higherlevel "broker" architectural layer; the paper identifieseight specific requirements for such an architecture thathave emerged from the experiments, derived from ananalysis of shortcomings which are collectively due to thestatic nature of the initial prototype. The way in whichthese are being met in the current version in order toachieve a more dynamic integration is described.
