Adding Authentication to Model Driven Security.As Service-Oriented Architecture has become popular, security has been a critical issue in multiple security domains using the WS-Security framework. The authentication requirements depend on the application semantics, but configuring authentication is very difficult for someone who is not a security expert, such as an application developer, because it is necessary to understand platform-specific security features and authentication mechanisms. To resolve these difficulties, we propose a framework for platformindependent security configuration based on the Model Driven Architecture. In this paper, we introduce a security qualifier, which is an abstract annotation for specifying authenticated identity on a platform-independent model, and a Security Infrastructure Model which is a model including the platform information required for creating security policies. These ideas make authentication configuration possible without understanding the platform-specific information, such as the federation of the security domain and the relationships of trust between the servers. Our framework allows a non-security expert to configure security easily. We show how to configure the authentication for an ID propagation scenario and discuss advantages of our framework compared to existing tools.
