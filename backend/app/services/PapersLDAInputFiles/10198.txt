A Requester-based Mediation Framework for Dynamic Invocation of Web Services.As the world of web services is dynamic and heterogeneous, a requester often needs to invoke an unfamiliar web service at run time. However, current web services technology pays little attention to this issue. In this paper, we propose a requester-based mediation framework for a requester to dynamically invoke web services. The framework can increase the flexibility and reliability of web services invocation in a truly dynamic, heterogeneous environment.
