The Design and Implementation of An OGSA-based Grid Information Service.The information service is a key component of aGrid environment and critical to the operation of acomputational Grid. In this work, an OGSA (OpenGrid Services Architecture) based Information Servicethat complies with OGSI (Open Grid ServicesInfrastructure) is presented. The main functionality ofthis Information Service is the provision of informationessential for applications running on a computationalGrid such as resource information, job status, resourceworkload, service meta-information, and queue status.This OGSI-compliant Information Service is built onGlobus Toolkit MDS-3, and it works with meta-schedulingservices and local job scheduling systemsto support resource discovery, job scheduling, andexecution management. In this paper, the architectureof the Information Service and the models ofinformation data organization are presented. Someimplementation issues are discussed as well.
