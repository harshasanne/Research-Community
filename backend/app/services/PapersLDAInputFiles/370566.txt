A DAML-Based Repository for QoS-Aware Semantic Web Service Selection.The Web is moving toward a collection of interoperatingWeb services. Achieving this interoperability requiresdynamic discovery of Web services on the basis of their capabilities.The capability of a service can be properly determinedby using not only its functional description (or serviceinterface), but also its quality attributes as judged byprevious users of the service. We develop a service repositorythat extends UDDI registries. This repository combinesan ontology of attributes with evaluation data.We base our repository on a new query and manipulationlanguage based on DAML. Our language includes supportfor a rich set of operations, which are needed to maintainan attribute ontology, publish services, rate services,and select services based on their functional attributes aswell as evaluations by others. We have implemented our approachand evaluated its practical completeness via a numberof key query and manipulation templates.
