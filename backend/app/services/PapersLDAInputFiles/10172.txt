Multi-Mobile Agents' Separation Scheme in Java Card Application for Mobile Agent's Security.As a kind of tamper resistant hardware, Java Card is regarded as a trusted third party that can operate safely on an untrusting host. At the same time, with the development of E-commerce, network management and mobile agent technology, multi-mobile agents' cooperation can not only improve the efficiency of distributed compute, but more importantly, it has a comprehensive applicative value in solving the security issues of mobile agent system. Aiming at settling the bottleneck of Java Card on mobile agents' congestion, this paper, proposes a multi-mobile agents' separation scheme in destination host. By a specific example, the paper analyzes the detailed process of this scheme for its security and validity. Furthermore, it provides the architecture of multi-mobile agents and other applications on how multi-mobile agents resist attacks primarily from the malicious executing hosts and draws some significant conclusions.
