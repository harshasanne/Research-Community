Web Service Gateway - A Step Forward to E-Business.Business-to-Business will be a considerable market inthe near future of Internet e-business. In this future market,several providers need to be able to integrate or exchangeinformation in providing a global service. The problemthat we want to tackle in this paper is related to theexisting information sources in the current Internetenvironment. That is how to integrate existing Web siteseach other to become a new Internet service ? Thedifficulty comes from a historical objective. Internet Websites were developed for human users browsing and so,they do not support machine-understandable as well asinter-provider interaction. To overcome this gap, we needa framework to systematically migrate the existingpresentation-oriented Web sites to service-oriented one.Evidently, redeveloping all of them is an unacceptablesolution.In this paper, we propose a mechanism of Web Servicegateway in which existing Web sites are wrapped byseveral Web Service wrappers. Thus, without any effortsto duplicate the Web sites code, these services inherit allfeatures from the sites while can be enriched with otherWeb Service features like UDDI publishing, semanticdescribing, etc... As a consequence, they can be easilyintegrated each-other in a Business-to-Business schema toprovide a more valuable service for users.This Web Service gateway was developed in Toshibawith Web Service Generator, allowing automaticallygenerate Web Service wrappers. By using this system,several "real" Web services were generated and madeavailable for use. The Web Service gateway and theseservices are also presented and evaluated in this paper.
