SOAR: SOcially Aware Routing for Request Matching in Enterprise Environments.A social networking model has been shown to be effective in routing queries in referral systems and cellular networks, and also in the production of frequently asked questions (FAQ) repository. In this paper, we extend its applicability to dispatch applications as part of resolving problem and change requests in an IT outsourcing environment. In such an environment, requests often get re-routed and traverse multiple work-groups before being resolved. However, the trail left behind resembles a thread of social interactions among subject matter experts (SMEs) in solving requests. We use such interactions to track the performance of each SME in resolving problems of different domains. In this work, we propose the SOcially Aware Routing (SOAR) system that leverages such social interactions to improve the accuracy and efficiency of routing future requests. The system can incorporate multiple routing policies and provides load-balancing while maintaining a high degree of routing accuracy. Based on preliminary evaluation, our scheme is found to attain an accuracy of 91% in the steady state.
