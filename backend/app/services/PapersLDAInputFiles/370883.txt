On Feature Interactions among Web Services.Web services promise to allow businesses to adaptrapidly to changes in the business environment, and theneeds of different customers. However, the rapid introductionof new services paired with the dynamicity of thebusiness environment also leads to undesirable interactionsthat negatively impact service quality and user satisfaction.In this paper, we propose an approach formodeling such undesirable interactions as feature interactions.Our approach for detecting interactions is basedon goal-oriented analysis and scenario modeling. It allowsus to reason about feature interactions in terms ofgoal conflicts, and feature deployment. Two case studiesillustrate the approach. The paper concludes with adiscussion, and an outlook on future research.
