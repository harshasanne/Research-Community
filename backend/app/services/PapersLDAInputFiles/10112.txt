Towards Service Collaboration Model in Grid-based Zero Latency Data Stream Warehouse (GZLDSWH).A Grid-based Zero-Latency Data Stream Warehouse (GZLDSWH), built upon a set of OGSI-based grid services and GT3 Toolkit, overcomes the resource limitation issue for data stream processing without using traditional approximate approaches. However, due to its "automated event-based reaction" characteristic, the GZLDSWH requires a mechanism which allows the grid services to be able to work together to fulfil the common tasks. This paper describes the Collaboration Model for the Grid Services which enables the automation of the GZLDSWH in capturing and storing continuous data streams, making analytical processing, and reacting autonomously in near real time with some kinds of events based on well-established Knowledge Base.
