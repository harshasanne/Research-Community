Componentization of Business Process Layer in the SOA Reference Architecture.This paper discusses and analyzes the Business Process layer in the SOA Solution Stack (S3) model, which is also known as the SOA Reference Architecture (SOA-RA). Business Process layer leverages the Service layer to quickly compose and choreograph services and to coordinate business processes to fulfill customer requirements. Based on industry practice, we introduce a set of architectural building blocks of the layer, together with the interdependencies and interactions between them, to componentize the Business Process layer in the context of SOA Reference Architecture. We also report industry experiences of applying this layer in SOA solution engagements.
