Formalized Model and Implementation of Service Virtualization.As the increasing development of application technologyand infrastructure, many kinds of application and resourcescan be encapsulated as web service and its variations, andservice-oriented computing become research hot. But, webelieve service-oriented computing should establish on virtualizedservice rather than concrete service instance directly. In this paper,we present formalized model of virtualized service and serviceinstance, and define the concept of service virtualization. Then,we propose the implementation solution of virtualized service- oriented application from perspective of global and local instantiation process.
