A CP-nets-based Design and Verification Framework for Web Services Composition.Web services aim to support efficient integration ofapplications over Web. Most Web services are stateful,such as services for business processes, and theyconverse with each other via properly orderedinteractions, instead of individual unrelatedinvocations. In order to address efficient integration ofconversational Web services, we create a unifiedspecification model for both conversation protocol andcomposition; we propose methods to integrate apartner service with complex conversation protocolinto a composition of Web services; assure thecorrectness of composition by formal verification. Themapping between our model and BPEL4WS is alsodiscussed.
