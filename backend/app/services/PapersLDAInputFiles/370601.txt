Dynamic Trust Establishment with Privacy Protection for Web Services.The lack of effective trust establishment mechanisms for webservices impedes the deployment of trust models for online services.One important issue is the lack of privacy protection in trustestablishment. Current web service technology encourages aclient to reveal all its attributes in a standard credential to the service provider for trust establishment. We propose a mechanismwhereby the client formulates a single trust primitive by associatinga subset of required attributes in a standard credential to negotiatea trust relationship. Client privacy is preserved because only those required attributes are revealed. After negotiation, a trustgroup element with dynamic validation is used to represent thistrust relationship.
