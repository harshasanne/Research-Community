An Infrastructure for E-Government Based on Semantic Web Services.Incomplete automation and lack of collaborative work can be frequently found in the traditional governmental information system. When using the system, a citizen has to discover the involved governmental services to satisfy his requirement and contacts with each of them. Semantic Web Services (SWS) in e-government can allow the automated web service discovery, selection and execution making the automatic composition of governmental services a reality. A citizen can gain the response conveniently after submitting the request to the platform of SWS. In this paper, SWS requirements in e-government are presented, and a conceptual architecture for SWS in e-government is proposed, furthermore a prototype system is designed to implement SWS in e-government.
