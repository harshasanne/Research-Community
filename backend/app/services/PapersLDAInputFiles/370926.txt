WS-Net: A Petri-net Based Specification Model for Web Services.The emerging paradigm of web services opens a newway of web application design and development toquickly develop and deploy web applications byintegrating independently published web servicescomponents to conduct new business transactions. Asresearch aiming at facilitating web services integrationand verification, WS-Net is an executable architecturaldescription language incorporating the semantics ofColored Petri-net with the style and understandability ofobject-oriented concepts. WS-Net describes each webservices component in three layers: interface net declaresthe services that the component provides to othercomponents; interconnection net specifies the servicesthat the component acquires to accomplish its mission;and interoperation net describes the internal operationalbehaviors of the component. As an architectural modelthat formalizes the architectural topology and behaviorsof each web services component as well as the entiresystem, WS-Net facilitates the verification and monitoringof web services integration.
