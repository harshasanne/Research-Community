Run-time Monitoring of Requirements for Systems Composed of Web-Services: Initial Implementation and Evaluation Experience.This paper describes a framework supporting the runtime monitoringof requirements for systems implemented as compositions of web- services specified in BPEL. The requirements that can be monitoredare specified in event calculus. The paper presents an overview of the framework and describes the architecture and implementation of a toolthat we have developed to operationalise it. It also presents the resultsof a preliminary experimental evaluation of the framework.
