Tools and Support for Deploying Applications on the Grid.Deploying applications on the Grid requires both a stable production quality infrastructure, and correct configuration of the user environment and applications. In this paper we discuss two support tools to assist in increasing the chance of successful execution of an application. The first is a set of scripts which we have developed and deployed on the UK e-Science Grid to check at a system level that resources are live and ready for use. These checks might be thought of as a 'heartbeat' for the Grid. The second is a support tool targeted at end users which allows them to verify that the specific resources they require are available and that their applications and user security settings are configured correctly. This verification gives a 'dial tone' for the application of the user. We demonstrate their deployment and use.
