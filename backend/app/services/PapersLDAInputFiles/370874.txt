Extending the Security Assertion Markup Language to Support Delegation for Web Services and Grid Services.Users of Web and Grid Services often must temporarily delegate someor all of their rights to a software entity to perform actions on their behalf.The problem with the typical Grid Services approach (X.509 proxycertificates) is that commercial Web Services tooling fails to recognize these certificates or process them properly. The Security Assertion MarkupLanguage (SAML) is a standardized XML-based framework for exchangingauthentication, authorization and attribute information. SAML has broadening commercial support but lacks delegation capabilities.To address this shortcoming, we exploit SAML's inherent extensibilityto create a delegation framework for Web and Grid Services that supportsboth direct and indirect delegation. We develop a set of verification rulesfor delegation tokens that rely on WSSecurity X.509 signatures, but donot force any trust relationship between the delegatee and the targetservice. We have implemented the framework on two common Web Service hosting environments: Java/Tomcat and .NET. By leveragingexisting Web Services standards, we make it easier for Grid practitionersto build and consume Web and Grid Services without resorting to Grid-specific protocols.
