Web Services for Information Extraction from the Web.Extracting information extraction from the Web is a complextask with different components which can either begeneric or specific to the task, going from downloading agiven page, following links, querying a Web-based applicationsvia an HTML form and the HTTP protocol, queryinga Web Service via the SOAP protocol, etc. Therefore buildingWeb Services which proceed to executing an informationtasks can not be simply hard coded (ie. written and compiledonce and for all in a given programming language).In order to be able to build flexible information extractionWeb Services we need to be able to compose different subtasks together. We propose a, XML-based language to describeinformation extraction Web Services as the compositionsof existing Web Services and specific functions. Theusefulness the proposed framework is demonstrated by threereal world applications. (1) Search engines : we show howto describe a task which queries Google's Web Service, retrievesmore information on the results by querying theirrespective HTTP servers, and filters them according to thisinformation. (2) E-Commerce sites : an information extractionWeb Service giving access to an existing HTML-basede-commerce online application such as Amazon is built. (3)Patent extraction : a last example shows how to describe aninformation extraction Web Service which allows to querya Web-based application, extract the set of result links, followthem, and extract the needed information on the resultpages. In all three applications the generated descriptioncan be easily modified and/or completed to further respondthe user's needs and create value-added Web Services.
