Managing the Intelligent Enterprise.This talk will describe challenges in managing the business operations of an intelligent enterprise. While a plethora of tools exist for managing the IT infrastructure (servers, storage, and network resources) of the enterprise, there is little systematic support today for the closed loop management and control of business operations. We will describe technology approaches to intelligent business operations management that we are pursuing at HP Labs., the progress we have made, and some open research questions.
