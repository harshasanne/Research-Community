Rough Formal Concepts and Their Accuracies.This research is concerned with Rough Concept, a synthesis of Rough Sets and Formal Concept Analysis. This theory is more expressive than ordinary approaches in knowledge representation and reasoning. Like Rough Sets theory, this research proposes an accuracy computing approach to characterizing the rough formal concept numerically and the role granules play there. And it also studies the basic relationship between the accuracy computing of Rough Form concept and granules.
