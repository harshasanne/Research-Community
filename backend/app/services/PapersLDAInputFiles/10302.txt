Model- and Architecture-Driven Development in the Context of Cross-Enterprise Business Process Engineering.Modelling and enacting Cross-Enterprise Business Processes (CBPs) is a key ability for successfully setting up and managing virtual organizations, e.g. supply chains. In this paper we present and compare approaches for modelling CBPs based on the serviceoriented architecture paradigm. By embedding our overall approach into a model- and architecturedriven development perspective, we show how serviceoriented systems realising CBPs can be derived from business-level modelling.
