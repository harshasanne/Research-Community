CredEx: User-Centric Credential Management for Grid and Web Services.User authentication is a crucial security component for most computingsystems. But since the security needs of different systems vary widely,authentication mechanisms are similarly diverse. In particular,independently managed Web and Grid Services vary with regardto the type of security token (credential) used to prove user identity(username/password, X.509 signing, Kerberos, etc.). Forcing usersto manage and present credentials manually for each service istedious, error-prone and potentially insecure. In contrast, we presentCredEx, an open-source, standards-based Web Service that facilitates the secure storage of credentials and enables the dynamic exchangeof different credential types using the WS-Trust token exchangeprotocol. With CredEx, a user can achieve single sign-on by acquiringa single (default) credential then dynamically exchanging that credentialas needed for services that authenticate a different way. We describethe design and implementation of CredEx by focusing on its use inbridging password-based Web Services and PKI-based Grid Services,illustrating how interoperability between these realms can be basedupon the WS-Security and WS-Trust specifications.
