Toward Intention Aware Semantic Web Service Systems.A goal driven intention extraction approach is proposed to automate the process of extracting user intention from the original Web service request terms. We introduce a method for analyzing the request terms to fit user intension, so that the service provided will be more suitable for the user. The input terms will be parsed into different word sense sets. With the lexical dictionary and domain ontology, possible senses of the terms will be identified. A goal structure is constructed to help the identification of goal models which represent the user intention. By combining the information of request terms and goal structures, one or more goal models will be identified. A goal selector will select a candidate goal model from generated goal models to represent the user intention. A service request agent is designed to generate and execute plans to satisfy the goals.
