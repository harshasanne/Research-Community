An Approach for Parallel Execution of Web Services.This paper presents a model which combines theprocessing power of parallel computation with theease of web service usage. In this model, parallelprogramming environment can be embedded in avisual environment. Parallelization of Web Services isprovided by using multi threading technology withdataset parameters. This work also provides parallelusage of computers located in different places via awide area network such as internet.
