Using Aspects for Security Engineering of Web Service Compositions.Web service composition languages promise a cheap and effectivemeans for application integration over the Internet as in typical B2Binteraction scenarios. BPEL is the upcoming standard for web servicecomposition and several implementations of it are already available. However, for web service composition languages to keep theirpromises it is essential to provide more support for security. Companieswill embrace web service composition languages only if theirrequirements of confidentiality, integrity, authentication, etc. are fulfilled. In this paper, we look at security in web services compositions andpresent a framework for securing BPEL compositions using WS-Securityand WS-Policy. The main components of our framework are theprocess container implemented by a set of aspects in AO4BPEL, anaspectoriented extension to BPEL, the security service and the deployment descriptor. We also introduce the notion of policy-basedprocess deployment to check the compatibility of the security policiesof the composition and its partners at deployment time.
