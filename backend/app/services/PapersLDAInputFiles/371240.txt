Trust Management for Web Services.In this paper, we propose a comprehensive trust management approach for web services that covers the analysis/modelling of trust relationships and the development of trust management layer in a consistent manner. The specific characteristics of trust relationships in web services are discussed. We introduce a separated trust management layer for web services that can hold computing components for trust management tasks. A trust management architecture for web services is proposed for building up the trust management layer. The proposed trust management architecture for web services deals with trust requirements, trustevaluation, and trust consumption in web services under a unified umbrella and it provides a solid foundation upon which may evolve the trust management layer for web services.
