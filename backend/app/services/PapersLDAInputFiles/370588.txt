Hyperdatabases for Peer-to-Peer Data Stream Processing.New sensor technologies, powerful mobile devices,and wireless communication standards strongly proliferateubiquitous and pervasive computing. This is particularlytrue for healthcare applications. Modern non-invasiveunobtrusive sensors enable sophisticated monitoring ofthe human body. As a result of this monitoring a growingamount of elderly people suffering from chronic diseaseswill benefit from an enhanced quality of life and improvedtreatment. Healthcare applications process a vastamount of continuously generated data, this has becomea serious challenge. Data stream managementaddresses this problem in general. However, healthcare applicationshave additional requirements, e.g., flexibilityand reliability. As a consequence, we propose the combinationof a sophisticated information infrastructure,called hyperdatabase, and data stream management. Hyperdatabasesalready allow for reliable process managementin a peer-to-peer fashion. In this paper, we elaboratethe close relation between distributed process managementand data stream management. Further, we show thatdata stream processing can significantly benefit from an infrastructurefor reliable process management. We presentthe architecture of our prototype infrastructure that supportsprocessing of continuous data streams with a highdegree of flexibility and reliability.
