Integrating Abductive Logic Programming and Description Logics in a Dynamic Contracting Architecture.In Semantic Web technologies, searching for a service means toidentify components that can potentially satisfy the user needs interms of outputs and effects (discovery), and that, when invoked bythe customer, can fruitfully interact with her (contracting).Inthis paper, we present an application framework that encompassesboth the discovery and the contracting steps, in a unified searchprocess.In particular, we accommodate service discovery byontology-based reasoning, and contracting by automated reasoningabout policies published in a formal language. To this purpose, weconsider a formal approach grounded on Computational Logic, andAbductive Logic Programming in particular. We propose a framework,called SCIFF Reasoning Engine, able to establish, by ontologicaland abductive reasoning, if a semantic web service and a requestercan fruitfully inter-operate, taking as input the behavioralinterfaces of both the participants, and producing as output a sortof a contract.
