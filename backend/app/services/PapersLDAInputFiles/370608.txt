A Meta-Modeling Approach to Web Services.Web Services (WS) technology is becoming pervasive inthe development of distributed systems and is anappealing vehicle for service presentation andhorizontal integration. On the other hand, ModelIntegrated Computing (MIC) offers a means of systemintegration in the vertical direction by using domain-specificmodeling, and then synthesizing the softwaresystem from the high-level model using a model-specificgenerator. This paper presents a meta-modelingapproach to WS to explore the application of MIC inWS development and its contribution.
